### üîç **Search Analytics & Research System**

**Overview**: While OpenQase currently has functional search capabilities across all content types, we lack visibility into user search behavior and content discovery patterns. The Search Analytics & Research system will provide data-driven insights into what users are actually looking for, enabling evidence-based content strategy and identifying opportunities for content creation.

**Key Features**:
- **Search Query Logging**: Track all search terms, frequency patterns, and search refinement behavior
- **Click-Through Analytics**: Monitor which search results get clicked, time-to-click, and search success rates
- **Content Gap Analysis**: Identify searches with no results or poor engagement to guide content creation
- **Trend Analysis**: Track search patterns over time to identify emerging topics and seasonal trends
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visual analytics interface showing popular searches, failed searches, and content recommendations

**Business Value**: This system will transform OpenQase from a content repository into an intelligence platform, providing actionable insights for content strategy, SEO optimization, and understanding the quantum computing landscape from a user perspective.
