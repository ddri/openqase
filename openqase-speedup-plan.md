  ```sql
  -- Example pattern for all junction tables
  CREATE INDEX idx_case_study_industry_relations_case_study_id ON case_study_industry_relations(case_study_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_case_study_industry_relations_industry_id ON case_study_industry_relations(industry_id);
  ```
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common query patterns
- [ ] Add indexes on frequently filtered columns (`published`, `published_at`)

#### 2.2 Query Optimization
- [ ] Replace `SELECT *` with specific column selections
- [ ] Implement single queries with JOINs instead of separate queries
- [ ] Add query result caching for static content
- [ ] Optimize Case Studies page query (already started)

- [ ] Optimize image loading with Next.js Image component

#### 2.4 Data Fetching Patterns
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for failed queries
- [ ] Add request deduplication for identical queries
- [ ] Implement pagination for large lists
- [ ] Add client-side caching with SWR or React Query

#### 3.2 RLS Policy Optimization
- [ ] Simplify complex RLS policies
- [ ] Move complex authorization logic to security definer functions
- [ ] Add targeted indexes for RLS filter columns
- [ ] Test policy performance with realistic user loads

### **Day 14-15: Caching Strategy**

#### 3.3 Multi-Level Caching
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for database queries
- [ ] Add Next.js revalidation strategies
- [ ] Implement static generation for stable content
