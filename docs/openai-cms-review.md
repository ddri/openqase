AI REVIEW

Below is a revised, version-15–aware review of your current CMS pattern, followed by a set of high-level recommendations for tightening up the architecture, improving DX, and scaling beyond a basic “published-flag” workflow.
Architecture Overview
• App-Router layout under src/app:
– Public site: /blog, /blog/[slug], /case-study/[slug], etc., all as server components that query published records.
– Admin UI: /admin/... pages use a mix of server (data-fetch) + client (interactive forms, tables) components.
– API routes: colocated under /src/app/api/[content-type]/route.ts, wired to a shared src/utils/content-management.ts layer that speaks to Supabase via anon vs. service-role clients.
• Supabase integration:
– SSR client (createServerClient/createClient) for reads in server components + middleware session.
– Service-role client (createServiceClient) for all writes, deletes, relationship management.
– RLS enforced via anon key for public reads, service key for writes—good separation.
• Authentication & Authorization (in src/middleware.ts):
– updateSession() ensures logged-in users get a valid cookie.
– Admin routes gated by checking user_preferences.role === 'admin'.
– Public “protected” routes (e.g. /profile, /paths) redirect to /auth if unauthenticated.
Next.js 15-Specific Features You Could Leverage
• React Server Actions
– Replace manual fetch('/api/...') in your client form handlers (e.g. create/update/delete) with action exports in the same file (colocated with the form). This eliminates round-trip API routes and simplifies auth/context handling.
• Built-in fetch caching & invalidation
– Use Next 15’s new export const cache = 'force-cache' | 'no-store' and the revalidateTag()/invalidateTag() APIs to selectively invalidate Admin lists after mutations, rather than full client-state refetches.
• Improved error.js/loading.js conventions
– Move your use-toast-based error handling into Next 15 route‐level error.js and loading.js components for cleaner UX and automatic streaming.
• Streaming & incremental hydration
– For long admin tables or relationship dropdowns, stream in “skeleton” rows while data hydrates, improving perceived performance.
Strengths of Your Current Pattern
• DRY, generic content utilities
– One saveContentItem(), deleteContentItem(), fetchContentItems(), etc., for all 5 content types.
• Clear server/client separation
– Data‐fetching in server components, interactivity in client components.
• Colocated APIs & pages
– Having /app/api/blog-posts/route.ts next to your Admin and public pages makes feature development quick.
• Robust middleware
– Fine-grained protection ensures only admins can hit /admin and unpublished records.
Areas for Improvement / Scaling Considerations
• Type safety & request validation
– Right now, your API handlers consume raw FormData / JSON into any. Introduce Zod schemas (or Next 15’s built-in validation) at the action/API boundary to catch malformed data in dev.
• Incremental data loading in admin lists
– Pulling all records and then client-filtering/sorting works up to ~100 items. For larger sets, switch your list page to server-side pagination or infinite scroll using cursor-based range calls (.range() + URL params).
• Asset & file management
– A bare featured_image: string field assumes you host images elsewhere. Consider integrating Supabase Storage (or Cloudinary) uploads as part of your Server Action so editors can attach images directly.
• Editorial workflow & versioning
– A single boolean published flag is fine for basic sites. If you need draft vs. review vs. scheduled publishing, introduce a status: enum['draft','pending','published'] and a published_at timestamp, or store revisions in a history table.
• Consolidate Supabase clients
– You currently import both @/utils/supabase/server, @/utils/supabase/client, and a src/lib/supabase-server.ts. You can merge these into a single supabase/ module that exports well-named helpers for SSR, service-role, and client-side usage.
• Move to Server-only actions for mutations
– With Server Actions you can colocate your create/edit logic directly in the form component (no API route needed). The nextjs15 compiler will handle the fetch for you and automatically revalidate caches/tags.
• Leverage route groups & colocation
– Consider grouping each content type under its own “route group” (e.g. src/app/(admin)/blog/... and src/app/(public)/blog/...) to share layouts, metadata, and loading/error UI more naturally.
• Search & indexing
– Full-text client filtering is fine for small tables. When you outgrow it, add Supabase’s built-in full-text search or integrate a lightweight search index (e.g. SQLite FTS, MeiliSearch) for admin-side search across titles, descriptions, tags.
Recommended Roadmap
Adopt Server Actions for all create/update/delete logic in your admin forms.
Define Zod schemas for each content type and wire them into your Actions or API handlers.
Implement cache tags around your list pages (export const tags = ['blog-posts']) and call revalidateTag('blog-posts') after mutations.
Refactor your Supabase utilities into a single, well-documented module (src/lib/supabase.ts) that exports getServerClient(), getServiceClient(), and optionally a withAuth() helper.
Add server-side pagination or cursor-based infinite loading for admin lists once you exceed ~200 items.
Build a minimal upload UI (using Supabase Storage or an external service) so images aren’t just URLs pasted into a text field.
Introduce a simple draft→review→publish workflow with status enums, scheduled publishing timestamps, and an optional audit log.
Overall, your foundation is solid for a lean, Supabase-backed CMS in Next 15. By embracing Server Actions, cache tags, route groups, and stronger type/validation guarantees, you’ll dramatically improve both developer DX and runtime performance as your content grows.
