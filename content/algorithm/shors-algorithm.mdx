Shor's algorithm is the most famous, and perhaps even infamous, of the family of quantum algorithms. It might not have been the first, but it has become the first-to-mind example in any discussion of the topic due to the very understandable nature of its potential impact on the world. Along with just a little of the paranoia and hype that surrounds quantum computing in the public eye.

The algorithm was developed by Peter Shor in 1994, and demonstrated the potential of quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. It quickly became such an influential quantum algorithm due to the potential impact on cryptography and its demonstration of quantum acceleration in a real-world problem space.

What does it solve?

The significance of Shor's algorithm lies in its ability to solve the integer factorisation problem exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. Many widely used public-key cryptography systems, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, rely on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally infeasible. However, Shor's algorithm shows that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could break these cryptographic systems in polynomial time, posing a serious threat to their security.
How does it work?At its core, Shor's algorithm relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to find the period of a modular exponential function. 

What are the steps?

The algorithm can be broken down into several key steps:

1. Quantum state preparation. The algorithm starts by preparing a superposition of quantum states that encode the integers from 0 to N-1, where N is the number to be factored.

2. Modular exponentiation. A unitary operation is applied to the quantum state, which performs modular exponentiation of a randomly chosen integer with respect to the input state. This operation creates a periodic structure in the quantum state. This step is performed efficiently using controlled quantum operations, a key advantage of quantum computation.

3. Quantum Fourier Transform. The Quantum Fourier Transform, a cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, is then applied to the first register. This transformation reshapes the quantum state, redistributing the probabilities associated with each possible measurement outcome. The resulting state encodes crucial information about the period of the modular exponentiation function.

4. Measurement. The quantum state is measured, collapsing it to a classical state that contains information about the period. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, steps 2-4 may need to be repeated multiple times to obtain a reliable estimate of the period.

5. Classical post-processing. The measured period is used to compute a factor of the original number N using classical algorithms, such as the continued fractions algorithm or the Euclidean algorithm. This step is probabilistic and may need to be repeated if it fails to find a non-trivial factor.

What is the real-world context?The efficiency of Shor's algorithm comes from its ability to exploit quantum parallelism and quantum interference to perform the modular exponentiation and QFT steps in a way that is exponentially faster than classical methods. By using a quantum computer to factor large integers, Shor's algorithm can achieve a time complexity of O((log N)³), compared to the best-known classical algorithms, which have a sub-exponential time complexity of O(exp((log N)^(1/3) (log log N)^(2/3))).

The potential impact of Shor's algorithm has led to a surge of interest in post-quantum cryptography, which aims to develop classical cryptographic systems that are secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. This includes the development of new cryptographic primitives based on mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, such as lattice-based cryptography and multivariate cryptography.

In addition to its implications for cryptography, Shor's algorithm has also inspired further research into quantum algorithms and quantum computing overall. It has led to the development of other important quantum algorithms, such as the Quantum Amplitude Amplification and the Quantum Counting algorithms, which have applications in various fields beyond cryptography.

What the the limitations?When it comes to real-world use, it’s the algorithm's hunger for qubits that presents the primary challenge. Factoring a number with n bits is generally assumed to require approximately 2n qubits of sufficient quality. The exact number depends on the implementation and algorithm variations but it serves as a useful rule of thumb to illustrate that a 2048-bit RSA key would likely require about 4096 qubits to factor it.

Now we must also account for the fragility of quantum states requiring extensive quantum error correction, further inflating the number of physical qubits required, potentially by orders of magnitude. This also ties into the challenge of coherence time; the quantum system must maintain coherence throughout the computation, a feat that becomes increasingly difficult as the size of the number to be factored grows.
Gate fidelity poses another hurdle. Shor's algorithm demands a large number of quantum gates applied with high precision, a requirement that strains current quantum hardware capabilities. As the size of the target number increases, the resources required by the algorithm scale up rapidly, creating significant scalability issues.

Outside of these functional issues, we can also appreciate that while Shor's algorithm is powerful for factoring and solving discrete logarithms, its speedup doesn't generalize to all computational problems. Its applicability is limited to specific mathematical challenges. And the algorithm relies on non-trivial classical post-processing, which can be computationally intensive for large numbers.

The sheer complexity of implementing Shor's algorithm on actual quantum hardware cannot be overstated. It requires precise control and manipulation of quantum states, which is a formidable challenge even for advanced quantum systems.

These limitations collectively mean that while Shor's algorithm poses a theoretical threat to certain cryptographic systems, practically breaking widely-used cryptographic keys remains out of reach for current and near-term quantum computers.

What’s the takeaway?

Shor's algorithm is a seminal quantum algorithm that demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. While its practical implementation remains a challenge, its theoretical importance and impact on cryptography and quantum computing research is foundational (and well worth your knowing). As quantum hardware continues to improve and scale up, Shor's algorithm will likely play a crucial role in shaping the future of cryptography and computing.
