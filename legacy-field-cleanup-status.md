# Legacy Field Cleanup Status

## Date: 2025-08-30

### Background
The case_studies table contained legacy TEXT[] array fields for quantum entities:
- `quantum_companies: string[] | null`
- `quantum_software: string[] | null`  
- `quantum_hardware: string[] | null`
- `partner_companies: string[] | null`

These were migrated to proper entities with junction tables for many-to-many relationships.

### Migration Status

#### Database Analysis
- **Legacy fields**: 49-57 case studies have populated legacy arrays
- **Junction tables**: 55-87 relationships exist (MORE than legacy fields)
- **Conclusion**: Migration successful, junction tables have more complete data

#### Code Changes Made

1. **Display Components** ✅
   - Removed fallback code from `/src/components/ui/professional-case-study-layout.tsx`
   - Now uses only junction table relationships

2. **Admin Form** ✅
   - Disabled TagInput fields in `/src/app/admin/case-studies/[id]/client.tsx`
   - Commented out legacy field initialization in form state
   - Removed legacy fields from save action in `actions.ts`
   - Added comment explaining entities are now managed separately

3. **Homepage** ✅
   - Removed company tag display from featured case studies

4. **CaseStudiesList Component** ⚠️
   - Still references legacy fields for filtering
   - Needs refactoring but low priority (not critical path)

### Testing Results
- Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- Public pages render correctly without legacy fields
- Admin form no longer attempts to save legacy data

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor for 2 weeks** (until ~2025-09-13)
   - Ensure no issues arise from disabled legacy fields
   - Verify junction table relationships are sufficient

2. **Run database migration** (after monitoring period)
   - Execute `cleanup-legacy-fields-migration.sql`
   - Creates backup table first
   - Drops the 4 legacy columns

3. **Future Enhancement** (Low Priority)
   - Add RelationshipSelector components for quantum entities in case study form
   - Allows admins to properly manage entity relationships
   - Currently admins must create entities first, then relationships separately

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Uncomment the TagInput fields in admin form
2. Restore form state initialization for legacy fields
3. Re-add fallback code to display components
4. Legacy data is preserved until final migration

### Decision Rationale
Instead of complex form refactoring, we:
- Disabled broken functionality (TagInput creates orphaned strings)
- Relied on existing junction table data (more complete)
- Minimized code changes to reduce risk
- Preserved option to enhance later

This approach follows the principle: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
