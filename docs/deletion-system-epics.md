# Content Deletion System - Implementation Epics

> **ðŸ“– Implementation Documentation**: For detailed technical documentation of the completed system, see [deletion-system-implementation.md](./deletion-system-implementation.md)

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive soft delete system for OpenQase CMS, following industry best practices from WordPress, Contentful, Ghost, and other leading platforms.

**Current Status**: Epics 1 & 2 COMPLETED âœ… (Foundation and Query Layer)

**Content Lifecycle:**
```
Draft â†’ Published â†’ Unpublished â†’ Archived â†’ Soft Deleted â†’ (30 days) â†’ Hard Deleted
         â†“                â†“           â†“            â†“
    (visible)        (hidden)     (hidden)    (recoverable)
```

## Success Metrics
- **Safety**: 0 accidental permanent deletions in first 6 months
- **Performance**: <5% query impact with 10k soft deleted records  
- **Recovery**: 100% successful recovery rate for soft deleted content
- **Compliance**: Full GDPR audit trail within 30 days
- **SEO**: <1% traffic loss from deleted content (via redirects)

## Epic 1: Foundation - Database Schema & Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority:** P0 | **Risk:** Low | **Industry Alignment:** âœ… High  
**Status:** COMPLETED (August 2025)

### User Stories
1. âœ… As a developer, I need deletion tracking columns added to all content tables so we can implement soft delete
2. âœ… As a system admin, I need proper indexes on deletion columns for query performance
3. âœ… As a developer, I need archive tables created for long-term storage of deleted content

### Implementation Tasks
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add columns to all content tables âœ…
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_by UUID DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived_by UUID DEFAULT NULL;

-- Phase 2: Create filtered indexes for performance âœ…
CREATE INDEX idx_case_studies_status ON case_studies(content_status);

-- Phase 3: Added content_status field and database functions âœ…
ALTER TABLE case_studies ADD COLUMN content_status VARCHAR(20);
CREATE FUNCTION soft_delete_content(...);
CREATE FUNCTION recover_content(...);
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All content tables have soft delete columns
- [x] Filtered indexes created for query performance
- [x] Migration scripts are reversible
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing queries

## Epic 2: Query Layer Updates - Soft Delete Filtering âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority:** P0 | **Risk:** Medium | **Industry Alignment:** âœ… High  
**Status:** COMPLETED (August 2025) - Implemented via Database Views

### User Stories
1. âœ… As a visitor, I should never see deleted content on the public site
2. âœ… As an admin, I need to optionally view deleted content in the trash
3. âœ… As a developer, I need consistent query behavior across all content types

### Implementation Approach (REVISED - View-Based)
```sql
-- Created database views for clean separation
CREATE VIEW public_case_studies AS 
  SELECT * FROM case_studies WHERE content_status = 'published';
  
CREATE VIEW admin_case_studies AS 
  SELECT * FROM case_studies WHERE content_status != 'deleted';
  
CREATE VIEW trash_case_studies AS 
  SELECT * FROM case_studies WHERE content_status = 'deleted';
```

```typescript
// Simple view-based access in code
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('admin_case_studies')  // Use appropriate view
  .select('*');
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All public queries exclude soft-deleted content (via public_ views)
- [x] Admin queries show non-deleted content (via admin_ views)
- [x] Trash queries show only deleted content (via trash_ views)
- [x] Performance impact minimal (indexed views)

## Epic 3: Two-Stage Deletion UI/UX
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk:** Low | **Industry Alignment:** âœ… High

### User Stories
1. As a content editor, I need a clear "Move to Trash" action that's reversible
2. As an admin, I need to manage trash with bulk operations
3. As a content editor, I need clear warnings when content has references

### UI Components Needed
- Trash management interface at `/admin/trash`
- "Move to Trash" buttons replacing "Delete"
- Recovery interface with bulk operations
- Reference warning dialogs

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Move to Trash" as primary delete action
- [ ] Trash interface with filters and search
- [ ] Reference warnings before deletion
- [ ] Bulk trash operations
- [ ] 30-day retention clearly communicated

---

## Epic 4: Referential Integrity & Cascade Management  
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk:** High | **Industry Alignment:** âœ… Critical

### User Stories
1. As a content editor, I need to understand impact before deleting referenced content
2. As a system, I need to maintain data integrity when content is deleted
3. As an admin, I need to recover content with all its relationships intact

### Cascade Strategy (Option A)
```typescript
// When deleting content with references:
1. Check all references
2. Show warning with count and details
3. On confirmation: Soft delete junction table entries
4. Soft delete main content
5. Recovery restores everything
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pre-deletion reference checking
- [ ] Cascade soft delete for junction tables
- [ ] Recovery restores all relationships
- [ ] No orphaned references in production
- [ ] Clear cascade documentation

## Epic 5: SEO & URL Management
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk:** Medium | **Industry Alignment:** âœ… High

### User Stories
1. As a site owner, I need deleted content URLs to redirect appropriately
2. As an SEO manager, I need to preserve search rankings when content is removed
3. As a developer, I need automatic redirect creation for deleted published content

### Implementation
```typescript
// Automatic redirect creation
async function handleContentDeletion(content) {
  if (content.published) {
    await createRedirect({
      from: content.url,
      to: findBestRedirectTarget(content),
      type: 301
    });
  }
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

## Industry Alignment

Our approach follows proven patterns from:
- **WordPress**: Two-stage deletion with trash (30+ million sites)
- **Contentful**: Reference checking and safety warnings
- **Ghost**: SEO-preserving redirects
- **Strapi**: Soft delete with lifecycle states
- **Drupal**: Role-based permissions and audit trails

**Industry Alignment Score: 9/10**

Missing only:
- Sanity's full revision system (overkill for our needs)
- Prismic's complex planning system (future enhancement)
