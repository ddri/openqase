It was developed by Gilles Brassard, Peter Høyer, and Alain Tapp in 1998 as an extension of Grover's search algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Problem Target\r\n\r\nThe QCA solves the problem of determining the number of solutions to a search problem[^2]. This might seem trivial at first, but for many real-world applications, the search space (the set of all possible solutions) can be incredibly vast. Trying to count the solutions classically could take an impractically long time.\r\n\r\nThe key point of the QCA is that it does this much more efficiently than classical methods[^3]. In some cases, it offers a quadratic speedup, meaning that it can count the solutions in a time that's proportional to the square root of the time it would take a classical algorithm. This can be a game-changer when dealing with large and complex search spaces.\r\n\r\n## Quantum Approach\r\n\r\nIn essence, the algorithm works by creating a superposition of all possible solutions to the search problem using Grover's algorithm[^4]. This superposition is then used as input to QPE, which estimates the phase of a unitary operator related to Grover's iteration. This phase information is directly linked to the number of solutions, allowing the algorithm to provide an accurate estimate with high probability[^5].\r\n\r\n## Implementation Steps\r\n\r\n<Steps>\r\n  <Step title="Initialisation">\r\n    Prepare a quantum register with two components, a work register (usually initialised to an equal superposition of all possible states) and an ancilla register (initialised to a specific state, usually |0⟩).\r\n  </Step>\r\n  <Step title="Grover Iteration">\r\n    Apply Grover's search algorithm to the work register with a modified oracle. This modified oracle marks all states that are solutions to the search problem. The number of Grover iterations is carefully chosen based on an estimate of the number of solutions.\r\n  </Step>\r\n  <Step title="Phase Estimation">\r\n    Apply QPE to the work register, using the Grover iteration as the unitary operator. QPE estimates the phase of the Grover iteration, which is related to the number of solutions[^6].\r\n  </Step>\r\n  <Step title="Measurement">\r\n    Measure the ancilla register to obtain an estimate of the phase. This phase estimate is then converted into an estimate of the number of solutions using classical post-processing.\r\n  </Step>\r\n  <Step title="Refinement (Optional)">\r\n    If the initial estimate is not sufficiently accurate, the process can be repeated with a modified number of Grover iterations to refine the estimate.\r\n  </Step>\r\n</Steps>\r\n\r\nThe QCA combines Grover's search and QPE to efficiently estimate the number of solutions to a search problem. It first uses Grover's algorithm to create a superposition of solutions and then applies QPE to extract information about their number. The resulting estimate can be further refined through repetition if needed.\r\n\r\n## Practical Applications\r\n\r\nThe QCA presents a significant advantage over classical counting methods, particularly when dealing with vast search spaces[^7]. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, it can often provide a quadratic speedup compared to its classical counterparts, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.\r\n\r\nIn the area of database search, QCA can rapidly estimate the number of items that meet specific criteria, streamlining the process of retrieving relevant information. For optimization problems, it can efficiently count feasible solutions, guiding the search for optimal solutions and enhancing the efficiency of optimization algorithms. In graph theory, QCA can determine the number of specific subgraphs within larger graphs, such as triangles or cliques, offering insights into the structure and properties of complex networks.\r\n\r\nQCA also finds applications in statistical analysis, where it can estimate the frequency of specific patterns within datasets, providing valuable information for data-driven decision-making. In the growing field of quantum machine learning, it plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of algorithms by efficiently counting relevant features or data points. This can lead to improved accuracy and faster convergence in various machine learning tasks.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Challenges\r\n\r\nDespite its impressive capabilities, the QCA algorithm has limitations that restrict its practical use in certain scenarios. One major constraint is its reliance on Grover's search algorithm. While Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup over classical search, it still requires a structured search space. In situations where the search problem lacks structure or has a complex oracle, QCA might not be the most efficient approach.\r\n\r\nAnother limitation is the impact of noise and errors inherent to quantum systems. QCA, like other quantum algorithms, is susceptible to errors caused by decoherence and imperfect quantum gates. These errors can accumulate during the computation, affecting the accuracy of the estimated count. Robust error correction techniques are crucial to mitigate these issues and ensure reliable results.\r\n\r\nQCA's effectiveness is also somewhat limited by the knowledge of the approximate number of solutions. While it can provide a more accurate estimate than classical methods, it still requires some prior information about the range of the count. For completely unknown solution counts, it might not be the optimal choice.\r\n\r\nFinally, the practical implementation of QCA on current quantum hardware faces challenges. The required number of qubits and quantum gates can scale with the problem size, making it difficult to implement for very large-scale problems. Additionally, the limited connectivity and coherence times of current quantum processors pose further obstacles to achieving the full potential of QCA.\r\n\r\n## Bottom Line\r\n\r\nOverall, the Quantum Counting Algorithm is a versatile tool with the potential to accelerate and enhance various computational tasks by efficiently estimating the number of solutions to search problems in the quantum realm.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[^1]: Brassard, G., Høyer, P., & Tapp, A.

This method is especially effective for combinatorial optimization challenges.	{TBD}	TBD	t	2025-04-28 05:53:59.617051+00	2025-05-11 13:37:11.513987+00	Quantum Annealing (QA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex optimization problems1. It is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy, where a metal is heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects and reach a low-energy crystalline state. Similarly, QA explores the solution space of an optimization problem by slowly evolving a quantum system from an initial state to a final state that encodes the optimal solution.\nProblem Target QA algorithms are particularly well-suited for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Max-Cut Problem, and the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem2. These problems are characterised by a large number of discrete variables and a complex energy landscape with many local minima, making them difficult to solve using classical optimization methods.\nQuantum Approach The key idea behind QA is to map the optimization problem onto a physical system of interacting qubits, where the energy of the system corresponds to the cost function of the problem3. The system is initialised in a state of quantum superposition, where each qubit represents a possible solution to the problem. The system is then slowly evolved according to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which gradually changes the strength of the interactions between the qubits and drives the system towards the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution4.\nImplementation Steps The algorithm can be broken down into several key steps:\n1. Problem encoding. The optimization problem is mapped onto a QUBO or Ising Hamiltonian, which describes the energy of the quantum system as a function of the binary variables. The mapping involves defining the couplings between the qubits and the local fields acting on each qubit, based on the constraints and objectives of the problem.\n2. Initialisation. The quantum system is initialised in a state of uniform superposition, where each qubit is in an equal superposition of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. This state represents a equal probability distribution over all possible solutions to the problem.\n3. Annealing. The quantum system is slowly evolved according to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which consists of two terms: a problem Hamiltonian that encodes the QUBO or Ising model, and a driver Hamiltonian that provides the quantum fluctuations needed to explore the solution space. The strength of the driver Hamiltonian is gradually decreased over time, while the strength of the problem Hamiltonian is increased, guiding the system towards the ground state.\n4. Measurement. After the annealing process is complete, the quantum system is measured in the computational basis, collapsing the superposition into a classical state that represents a candidate solution to the problem. The measurement is repeated multiple times to obtain a statistical distribution of the solutions.\n5. Post-processing. The candidate solutions are post-processed using classical optimization techniques, such as local search or simulated annealing, to further improve their quality and remove any invalid or suboptimal solutions.\nPractical Applications QA holds the promise of outperforming classical optimization algorithms in several key aspects. One notable advantage is its potential for faster convergence. By harnessing quantum tunnelling and quantum entanglement, QA can navigate the solution space more efficiently, potentially finding the optimal solution faster than classical methods, especially for problems with complex energy landscapes where classical algorithms might become trapped in local minima5.\nAnother compelling advantage lies in its scalability potential. QA can potentially tackle larger and more intricate problems that overwhelm classical algorithms. This is due to the exponential nature of quantum state spaces, where a relatively small number of qubits can represent and manipulate exponentially large superpositions.\nFurthermore, QA benefits from an inherent robustness to certain types of noise and errors, such as thermal fluctuations and control errors. This resilience stems from the adiabatic nature of the algorithm, making it well suited for near-term quantum hardware, which is often prone to such disturbances6.\nImplementation Challenges Despite its promising potential, the practical implementation of QA faces several hurdles. One significant challenge lies in the limited connectivity between qubits in current quantum annealing hardware. This limitation can make mapping certain problems onto the hardware difficult, leading to additional overhead in problem encoding and a potential reduction in performance7.\nAnother issue is the sensitivity of QA's performance to various parameters, such as the annealing schedule, the initial and final Hamiltonians, and other settings. Determining the optimal parameter configuration for a specific problem can be a complex task, often requiring extensive empirical tuning and experimentation.\nFurthermore, comparing QA with classical optimization algorithms is crucial for assessing its true potential. In some cases, classical methods like simulated annealing or tensor networks can perform as well as or even outperform it, particularly when dealing with small problem sizes or less complex energy landscapes. Therefore, rigorous benchmarking and comparison with classical approaches are essential for understanding the specific scenarios where QA can offer a quantum advantage8.\nBottom Line Quantum Annealing is a powerful metaheuristic optimization algorithm that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By mapping the problem onto a system of interacting qubits and slowly evolving the system towards the ground state, QA has the potential to provide faster convergence, better scalability, and robustness to noise compared to classical optimization methods. \nQA has been extensively studied and applied to various optimization problems in fields such as machine learning, finance, logistics, and materials science. Experimental demonstrations have been performed on quantum annealing hardware, such as the D-Wave systems, as well as on gate-based quantum computers and quantum simulators.\nOngoing research in QA aims to develop more efficient and scalable algorithms, improve the mapping and encoding of problems, and benchmark the performance of it against classical methods, paving the way for the practical deployment in real-world applications. 1.

15f5c62d-1f8e-4986-93f0-ad7fdcf90527	bernstein-vazirani-algorithm	Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm	The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently determines a secret string of bits encoded within a function, using only a single query, which is exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.	{TBD}	TBD	t	2025-04-21 13:30:41.916342+00	2025-05-11 13:13:42.157718+00	The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm was introduced by Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani in 1992[^1], and is designed to find a hidden string (or a secret key) in a black-box function using fewer queries than classical algorithms.\n\n## Problem Target\n\n The problem addressed by the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be formulated as follows: given a black-box function f(x) that takes an n-bit binary string x as input and returns a single bit, find the secret n-bit string s that satisfies the following condition: f(x) = s · x (mod 2) where · denotes the bitwise inner product (or dot product) modulo 2. In other words, the function f(x) is a linear function that computes the parity of the bitwise AND of the input string x and the secret string s.\n\nClassically, finding the secret string s requires n queries to the black-box function, as each query reveals one bit of information about s. However, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can find the secret string using only one query to a quantum oracle that implements the function f(x)2.\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\n The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm achieves this result by exploiting the properties of quantum superposition and interference. The Hadamard gates create a superposition of all possible input strings, allowing the quantum oracle to evaluate the function f(x) for all inputs simultaneously. The oracle encodes the secret string into the phases of the quantum state, which are then converted into amplitudes by the second set of Hadamard gates. Finally, the measurement of the quantum state reveals the secret string3.\n\n## Practical Applications \n\nThe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm demonstrates a clear advantage of quantum computing over classical computing for this specific problem, as it requires only one query to the oracle, compared to the n queries required classically4. Although the problem itself is relatively simple and has limited practical applications, the algorithm has theoretical importance in the field of quantum computing.\n\nThe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm has been experimentally demonstrated on various quantum computing platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)5, linear optics6, and superconducting qubits7. These experimental realisations have validated the principles of the algorithm and have paved the way for the development of more complex quantum algorithms.\n\nMoreover, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm has inspired further research in the field of quantum query complexity, which studies the number of oracle queries required to solve certain problems using quantum algorithms8. This research has led to the development of other quantum algorithms, such as the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and Simon's algorithm, which also demonstrate quantum speedups over classical algorithms.\n\n## Implementation Challenges \n\nThe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm’s primary constraint lies in its narrow focus, as it's tailor-made for the singular task of determining a hidden string given a particular type of function. This specialisation restricts its direct applicability to other computational challenges9.\n\nFurthermore, the algorithm operates under the assumption of a quantum oracle capable of efficiently evaluating the required function. While theoretically feasible, constructing such oracles for real-world problems can pose a significant hurdle10. Consequently, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm's practical applications remain limited, primarily serving as a theoretical testament to the potential power of quantum computing.\n\nAdditionally, like other quantum algorithms, it's susceptible to errors arising from noise and decoherence in quantum systems, which can compromise accuracy and hinder its practicality for larger problem sizes11. The algorithm's scalability also remains an open question, as the resources required might increase exponentially with the problem size, potentially limiting its effectiveness for large-scale computations.\n\n## Bottom Line \n\nThe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm that showcases the power of quantum computing in solving a specific problem with a clear quantum advantage over classical methods. While the problem itself may have limited practical applications, the algorithm has theoretical significance and has inspired further research in quantum query complexity and the development of more advanced quantum algorithms. \n\n\n\n\n\n	2025-04-22 13:20:11.822+00	## Implementation Steps\n\n<Steps>\n    <Step title="State preparation">\n         Initialise an n-qubit quantum state |ψ⟩ in the |0⟩ state and an ancilla qubit in the |1⟩ state.\n    </Step>\n    <Step title="Apply Hadamard gates">\n        Apply a Hadamard gate to each of the n qubits and the ancilla qubit.

This demonstrates a clear quantum advantage for search and optimization problems.\n\n## Algorithm Details\n\nGrover's algorithm was developed soon after Shor's, this time seeing Lov Grover publishing his own breakthrough in 1996[^1]. His focus was on creating a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database quadratically faster than the best possible classical algorithm. It is one of the most well-known and widely studied quantum algorithms, with numerous applications in various fields, such as database search, optimisation, and machine learning.\n\n## Problem Target\n\nGrover's algorithm addresses the problem of searching an unsorted database or solving an unstructured search problem. Given a large set of N items, it finds a specific item or solution that satisfies a given condition, often referred to as the "marked item" or "solution state"[^2]. In the classical setting, this problem requires O(N) operations in the worst case, as one might need to search through all N items to find the desired one. Grover's algorithm can solve this problem using only O(√N) quantum operations, providing a quadratic speedup over classical methods[^3].\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe key idea behind Grover's algorithm is the concept of amplitude amplification, which allows the algorithm to increase the amplitude of the quantum state corresponding to the desired item, while decreasing the amplitudes of the other states[^4]. This is achieved through a series of quantum operations that are applied iteratively to the quantum state, gradually transforming it into a state where the desired item has a high probability of being measured. This process effectively "rotates" the system state towards the solution through a process of phase amplification and attenuation.\n\n## Practical Applications\n\nGrover's algorithm has been experimentally demonstrated on various quantum computing platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, photonic, and silicon qubits[^5]. It has also been applied to a wide range of problems beyond database search, such as optimisation, machine learning, and quantum chemistry.\n\nOne of the most significant applications of Grover's algorithm is in the field of optimisation. By combining Grover's algorithm with classical optimisation techniques, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA), researchers have developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that can solve complex optimisation problems faster than purely classical methods[^6].\n\nThis combination of quantum and classical approaches gives some clues as to the utility beyond the "quantum is the future" hype curve, and shows the potential for incremental but significant improvements in existing workflows and problem spaces. It also shows how any singular advancement can inspire and combine with other efforts to unlock further fields of study. \n\nIn this way, Grover's algorithm has had a profound impact on the theoretical foundations of quantum computing. It has led to the development of new quantum algorithms and techniques, such as Quantum Amplitude Amplification and Quantum Counting, which have further expanded the capabilities of quantum computers and associated research.\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\nThe efficiency of Grover's algorithm comes from its ability to exploit quantum parallelism and quantum interference to search the database in a way that is quadratically faster than classical methods. Note that this is "just" a quadratic speedup, compared to the exponential benefits found in the various applications other quantum algorithms in their specific problem space.\n\nThe standard disclaimer in the NISQ era also applies, where the true extent of the algorithm's performance relies on the eventual realisation of a fault-tolerant quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits[^7]. The decoherence and noise in the current range of available quantum hardware limit the number of iterations that can be performed accurately. \n\nAnother condition that is common to most if not all quantum algorithms is the actual implementation via the intended SDK and platform, where the oracle function must be implemented efficiently as a quantum circuit. It's useful to keep in mind that not all systems or architectures will transpile the same way, or achieve the same performance in the process.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nGrover's algorithm is a powerful and versatile quantum algorithm that demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to solve certain problems quadratically faster than classical computers. Its impact on various fields, from database search and optimisation to machine learning and quantum chemistry, highlights the broad applicability of quantum algorithms. But in the current era, the full benefits of Grover's algorithm is limited to simulation or smaller scale and noisy quantum hardware, which inversely means that Grover's algorithm and its variants will likely play an increasingly important role in the near-term future.\n\n	2025-04-24 06:36:11.712+00	<Steps>\n  <Step title="Initialisation">\n    The algorithm starts by preparing a uniform superposition of all possible states, where each state corresponds to an index in the database.

Boltzmann machines are probabilistic graphical models that learn the probability distribution underlying a set of input data and can be used for tasks such as unsupervised learning, generative modeling, and combinatorial optimization.\nProblem Target QBMs exploit the power of quantum computing to represent and manipulate complex probability distributions more efficiently than classical Boltzmann machines, particularly for high-dimensional and strongly correlated data2. The key idea behind QBMs is to use quantum states and quantum operations to represent the model parameters and perform the learning and inference tasks.\nQuantum Approach A QBM consists of a network of quantum nodes, each representing a qubit or a group of qubits, and connected by quantum edges that encode the interactions between the nodes3. The quantum state of the QBM represents the joint probability distribution of the variables in the model, and the goal of training is to adjust the parameters of the quantum edges to minimize the difference between the model distribution and the target distribution of the input data.\nImplementation Steps The algorithm can be broken down into several key steps:\n1. State preparation. The input data is encoded into a quantum state, typically using amplitude encoding or qubit encoding. In amplitude encoding, each data sample is represented by a quantum state, where the amplitudes of the basis states correspond to the feature values. In qubit encoding, each feature is assigned to a qubit, and the feature values are encoded in the qubit states.\n2. Model initialisation. The parameters of the QBM, such as the weights of the quantum edges and the biases of the quantum nodes, are initialised to random values or based on prior knowledge.\n3. Quantum sampling. A quantum sampling algorithm, such as quantum annealing or quantum Gibbs sampling, is used to generate samples from the model distribution4. These algorithms exploit the quantum superposition and quantum tunnelling effects to explore the state space more efficiently than classical sampling methods.\n4. Gradient estimation. The gradients of the model parameters with respect to the objective function, such as the log-likelihood or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are estimated using the quantum samples and classical post-processing. This can be done using techniques such as quantum back-propagation or quantum natural gradient.\n5. Parameter update. The model parameters are updated based on the estimated gradients, using classical optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Adam.\nSteps three to five are repeated until the model converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached. After training, the QBM can be used for tasks such as data generation, anomaly detection, and classification, by sampling from the learned distribution or computing the probabilities of the input data.\nPractical Applications The potential advantages of QBMs over classical Boltzmann machines include some of the usual themes we might expect in such quantum explorations. The exponential speedup is a benefit for certain types of data and model architectures, where QBMs can provide an exponential speedup over classical Boltzmann machines in terms of training time and model capacity5. This is due to the ability of quantum computers to represent and manipulate exponentially large state spaces with a linear number of qubits.\nThese quantum states and quantum operations can potentially capture more complex and expressive probability distributions than classical models, due to the presence of entanglement and interference effects6. Likewise the improved generalisation of QBMs may result in more robust representations of the input data, by exploiting the quantum superposition and quantum parallelism effects to explore a larger hypothesis space.\nImplementation Challenges QBMs face the usual collection of limitations given their reliance on near-term quantum devices. Developing efficient methods for encoding large-scale and high-dimensional classical data into quantum states, while preserving the relevant features and correlations, requires efficient data encoding in the first place. Similar issues exist with designing QBM architectures that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum hardware with limited qubit count and gate fidelity. One such example is in noise-resilient training, where the development of robust QBM training algorithms that can operate in the presence of noise and errors in the quantum hardware, requires continual advances in techniques such as error mitigation and quantum error correction.\nThe practical application of integrating with classical machine learning is also a concern in the current era7. There is much work to be done in exploring hybrid quantum-classical approaches that combine QBMs with classical machine learning techniques, such as pre-training, fine-tuning, and transfer learning, to use the strengths of both paradigms. Experimental demonstrations of QBMs have been reported on various quantum computing platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and quantum annealers, showing promising results for small-scale datasets. However, the scalability and performance of QBMs on larger and more realistic datasets remain open research questions.\nBottom Line Quantum Boltzmann Machines are a promising class of quantum machine learning models that exploit the power of quantum computing to learn and represent complex probability distributions more efficiently than classical models. By exploiting the quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference effects, QBMs have the potential to provide exponential speedups and enhanced expressivity compared to classical Boltzmann machines, with applications ranging from unsupervised learning and generative modeling to optimization and decision-making. \nHowever, significant research efforts are still needed to address the challenges of efficient data encoding, scalable model architectures, noise-resilient training, and integration with classical machine learning techniques, before QBMs can be deployed in real-world scenarios. As quantum technologies continue to advance, QBMs are expected to play an important role in the emerging field of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence. 1. Amin, M.

758dbf16-2b51-4c12-8351-1512a7f5ae03	deutsch-jozsa	Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm	The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves the problem of determining if a black-box function is constant or balanced in a single query, offering an exponential speedup compared to classical deterministic approaches.	{}		t	2025-04-21 13:32:20.191392+00	2025-05-11 13:25:14.643747+00	The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was developed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 [^1] . It is one of the earliest examples of a quantum algorithm that demonstrates an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for a specific problem. Although the problem it solves is somewhat artificial, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is of great theoretical importance as it provides a clear example of the power of quantum computing and has inspired further research in the field.\n\n## Problem Target\n\n The problem addressed by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is as follows: given a function f that takes an n-bit binary string as input and returns either 0 or 1, determine whether the function is constant (returns the same value for all inputs) or balanced (returns 0 for exactly half of the inputs and 1 for the other half). The function is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced.\n\nClassically, the only way to solve this problem with certainty is to evaluate the function for all 2n possible inputs, which requires 2n function evaluations. However, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can solve this problem using only one function evaluation on a quantum computer, demonstrating an exponential speedup over classical methods [^2].\n\n## Quantum Approach \n\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm displays a fundamental quantum computing strategy, namely the use of quantum superposition and interference to extract global properties of a function efficiently3. Unlike classical algorithms that must examine individual inputs separately, this quantum approach allows for the simultaneous evaluation of a function across its entire input space. By encoding the function's behaviour into the phases of a quantum state and then using interference effects, the algorithm can distill information about the overall nature of the function—specifically, whether it's constant or balanced—without needing to know its value for any specific input4. \n\n## Practical Applications \n\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has played a crucial role in the development of quantum computing theory5. It has served as a foundation for more advanced quantum algorithms, such as Simon's algorithm and Shor's algorithm, which have significant implications for cryptography and other fields.\n\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been experimentally demonstrated on various quantum computing platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), linear optics, and superconducting qubits6. These experimental realisations have helped to validate the principles of quantum computing and have paved the way for the development of more complex quantum algorithms and hardware.\n\n## Implementation Challenges \n\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, while theoretically significant, has several limitations that restrict its practical utility. Primarily, the problem it solves—determining whether a function is constant or balanced—is rather artificial and rarely encountered in real-world applications7. The algorithm also requires the function to be implemented as a quantum oracle, which can be challenging for complex functions. And it only provides a speedup for functions that are guaranteed to be either constant or balanced. So for functions that might be neither, the algorithm loses its advantage.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, the algorithm's impact is (like all the algorithms you’re encountering here) limited by the current state of quantum hardware. It requires a fault-tolerant quantum computer to fully realise its potential, which is not yet available. Additionally, for small input sizes where classical computers can efficiently solve the problem, the overhead of quantum state preparation and measurement may outweigh the benefits of the quantum speedup. \n\nDespite these limitations, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm remains valuable as a concept, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing and inspiring the development of more practical quantum algorithms.\nBottom Line The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a seminal quantum algorithm that demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. While the practical applications are limited, the theoretical importance and impact on the field of quantum computing has been significant and has earned its reputation as one of the foundational quantum algorithms to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	2025-04-21 13:32:20.191392+00	<Steps>\n  <Step title="Initialisation">\n   The algorithm starts by preparing two quantum registers: an n-qubit register initialised to the state |0⟩n, and a single-qubit register initialised to the state |1⟩.

7557a852-28e4-4b69-a2d6-683471f38ffb	harrow-hassidim-lloyd	Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)	The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm is designed to solve systems of linear equations, particularly when the matrices involved are large and sparse, potentially offering exponential speedups in specific applications.	{}		t	2025-04-22 06:04:47.057298+00	2025-05-11 13:29:47.402862+00	The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations[^1]. Published in 2009, it provides an exponential speedup over classical methods for certain well-conditioned sparse systems of linear equations, making it a significant milestone in quantum computing[^2].\n\n## Problem Target\n\nThe HHL algorithm addresses the problem of solving systems of linear equations of the form Ax = b, where A is an N × N Hermitian matrix, b is a known vector, and x is the solution vector we want to find[^3]. While classical algorithms like Gaussian elimination require O(N³) operations, HHL can achieve this in O(log(N)) time under certain conditions, though with some important caveats[^4].\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe algorithm works by encoding the problem in a quantum state and using quantum phase estimation along with controlled rotations to extract the solution[^5]. The key steps involve:\n\n1. Quantum state preparation of |b⟩\n2. Quantum phase estimation to estimate eigenvalues of A\n3. Controlled rotations based on eigenvalues\n4. Inverse quantum phase estimation\n5. Measurement of the result[^6]\n\n## Practical Applications\n\nThe HHL algorithm has potential applications in various fields[^8]. The efficiency of the HHL algorithm makes it particularly promising for applications in science, engineering, and finance, where linear systems are ubiquitous. It's important to note that the algorithm outputs a quantum state encoding the solution, not a classical vector. This characteristic highlights both the potential and challenges of quantum computing: while it can process certain information exponentially faster, extracting useful classical data from the quantum state can be complex.\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\nThe HHL algorithm achieves its exponential speedup by exploiting quantum parallelism to perform the phase estimation and controlled rotation steps efficiently. A primary constraint of the HHL algorithm is its requirement for the input matrix A to be both sparse and well-conditioned, meaning it must have a small condition number. This specificity limits the algorithm's applicability, as the quantum speedup may be lost when dealing with dense or ill-conditioned matrices, which are common in many real-world problems. \n\nAdditionally, the algorithm's output is not a classical vector but a quantum state proportional to the solution vector x. While this quantum state contains the solution, extracting the classical information requires quantum state tomography, a process that can be resource-intensive and potentially offset the algorithm's speed advantages for certain applications.\n\nAnother significant limitation lies in the algorithm's assumption that the matrix A and vector b can be efficiently prepared as quantum states. In practice, this state preparation can be challenging, particularly for large-scale problems, and may introduce additional complexities that impact the overall efficiency of the algorithm.\n\nThese limitations highlight the nuanced nature of quantum speedups and the importance of considering the entire computational process, from input preparation to output interpretation, when evaluating the practical utility of quantum algorithms. 1.

SIAM Journal on Computing, 46(6), 1920-1950. \n\n## Bottom Line\n\nDespite these constraints, the HHL algorithm has generated considerable excitement in the quantum computing community. It has sparked significant interest in the potential of quantum computing for solving linear systems and related problems, finding applications in diverse domains such as machine learning, data fitting, and differential equations. Experimental demonstrations on small-scale quantum computers have showcased the algorithm's feasibility, albeit on a limited scale. \n\nAs quantum hardware continues to advance and scale up, there's optimism that the HHL algorithm and its variants may find increasing applications in solving large-scale linear systems and other related problems, potentially overcoming some of the current limitations through improved quantum technologies and algorithmic refinements.\n	2025-04-22 07:14:05.696+00	\n<Steps>\n  <Step title="State Preparation">\n    Convert the vector b into a quantum state |b⟩.

It was introduced by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann in 2014 as a general-purpose algorithm for finding approximate solutions to hard optimization problems that are difficult to solve using classical computers1. QAOA has attracted significant attention in the quantum computing community due to its potential to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices.\n\n## Problem Target\n\n The goal of QAOA is to find the optimal solution to a given optimization problem, which can be expressed as finding the ground state of a corresponding classical Hamiltonian2. The algorithm works by preparing a parameterised quantum state using a series of alternating quantum operations, and then optimizing the parameters using a classical optimization algorithm to minimize the energy of the resulting state.\n\nQuantum Approach QAOA works by encoding an optimization problem into a quantum circuit that alternates between two types of operations: a problem-specific phase separation operator and a mixing operator3. It then uses a classical optimization algorithm to adjust the parameters of this quantum circuit, aiming to minimize the expectation value of the problem Hamiltonian. The process iterates between running the quantum circuit and classical optimization until convergence, producing an approximate solution to the original optimization problem.\n\n\n\n## Practical Applications \n\nOne of the key advantages of QAOA is its flexibility and applicability to a wide range of optimization problems, including Max-Cut, graph colouring, and satisfiability problems5. By adjusting the number of alternating layers in the QAOA ansatz, one can trade off between the quality of the approximate solution and the computational resources required. In the limit of an infinite number of layers, QAOA can theoretically converge to the optimal solution, although this is not practically feasible due to the limitations of current quantum hardware.\n\nQAOA has been experimentally demonstrated on various quantum computing platforms, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions6. It has been applied to a range of optimization problems and has shown promising results in finding approximate solutions that are competitive with classical methods.\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\n There are still open questions and challenges regarding the performance and scalability of QAOA. The choice of the mixing operator and the efficiency of the classical optimization algorithm can significantly impact the quality of the approximate solutions and the computational resources required7. Moreover, the presence of noise and errors in near-term quantum devices may limit the depth of the QAOA ansatz and the accuracy of the results.\n\nDespite these challenges, QAOA remains an active area of research in the quantum computing community, with ongoing efforts to improve its performance, develop new variants and extensions, and apply it to real-world optimization problems. As quantum hardware continues to improve and scale up, QAOA and related algorithms are expected to play an increasingly important role in demonstrating the potential of quantum computing for solving hard optimization problems.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n At the time of writing it looks like QAOA is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its flexibility, applicability to a wide range of problems, and potential to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term devices make it an important tool in the quantum computing toolbox. As research in QAOA and related algorithms continues to advance in the NISQ era, we can expect to see new developments and applications emerging, although it is unclear what the future of the algorithm will be as we reach fault-tolerant quantum computing. \n\n	\N	<Steps>\n  <Step title="Problem encoding">\n    The optimization problem is mapped onto a classical Hamiltonian, which encodes the objective function and constraints of the problem. The Hamiltonian is typically expressed as a sum of local terms that can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer.\n  </Step>\n  <Step title="Ansatz preparation">\nA parameterised quantum circuit, called the QAOA ansatz, is constructed by alternating two types of quantum operations: a phase separation operator, which encodes the classical Hamiltonian, and a mixing operator, which introduces quantum fluctuations and enables the exploration of the solution space.\n</Step>\n  <Step title="Expectation value measurement">\nThe expectation value of the classical Hamiltonian with respect to the QAOA ansatz is estimated by measuring the output of the quantum circuit and averaging the results over multiple runs. This step requires the efficient evaluation of the local terms in the Hamiltonian.\n</Step>\n  <Step title="Classical optimization.">\nA classical optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent or Bayesian optimization, is used to update the parameters of the QAOA ansatz to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The optimization process iterates between steps 3 and 4 until convergence is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached4.\n</Step>\n  <Step title="Result interpretation">\nThe final converged parameters of the QAOA ansatz represent an approximate solution to the optimization problem, and the corresponding expectation value provides an estimate of the quality of the solution.\n</Step>	[^1]: Farhi, E., Goldstone, J., & Gutmann, S.

f2b23a03-f51f-488f-aaba-13c3610c6385	classiq-sumitomo-corporation-financial-risk-management	Classiq and Sumitomo Corporation	Exploring quantum computing for financial risk management, achieving up to 95% compression of quantum circuits for Monte Carlo simulations.	In March 2025, Classiq Technologies, a leading quantum computing software company, partnered with Sumitomo Corporation and Mizuho-DL Financial Technology to achieve a significant breakthrough in quantum computing applications for financial risk management. The collaboration successfully demonstrated up to 95% compression of quantum circuits for Monte Carlo simulations, marking a major milestone in making quantum computing viable for practical financial applications.\n\n## The Financial Risk Management Challenge\n\nFinancial institutions routinely employ Monte Carlo simulations for derivative pricing and asset risk evaluation, essential processes for managing investment portfolios and complying with regulatory requirements. However, these simulations require generating vast numbers of random scenarios, leading to high computational costs and extended processing times on classical computers.\n\nTraditional risk assessment methods, particularly for credit portfolio risk management, involve evaluating numerous complex variables and potential scenarios. For large financial institutions, running these simulations can take hours or even days, limiting the ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions or to perform comprehensive risk assessments with the desired frequency and accuracy.\n\nQuantum computing offered potential solutions to these computational challenges, but practical implementation faced significant hurdles. Quantum circuits for financial simulations typically required either a large number of qubits or deep circuits with many operations, making them difficult to run efficiently on current quantum hardware with limited qubit counts and high error rates.\n\n## Quantum Solution\n\nThe partners developed an innovative approach to quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo simulations that leveraged Classiq's quantum software platform and specialized algorithms provided by Mizuho-DL Financial Technology. The project focused on two distinct methods for implementing quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n- Traditional Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation: This approach required a dedicated qubit for each random number needed in the simulation, leading to high qubit usage but relatively shallow circuits.\n\n- Pseudo-Random Number-Based Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation: This novel method, developed by Mizuho-DL FT, generated necessary random patterns in stages, significantly reducing the required qubit count at the cost of deeper, more complex circuits.\n\nTo optimize these quantum approaches, Classiq applied its quantum circuit compression technology. The company's high-level quantum language, Qmod, enabled the team to generate optimized circuits for both simulation methods, focusing on reducing circuit depth while maintaining computational accuracy.\n\nThe solution was designed to address the practical limitations of current quantum hardware, which typically features limited qubit counts and is susceptible to errors, particularly in deep circuits. By optimizing circuit design, the partners aimed to enable financial institutions to run complex risk simulations more efficiently than possible with classical computing alone.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation process began with Sumitomo Corporation, which had established its Quantum Transformation (QX) project in 2021 to revolutionize business processes through quantum computing . Sumitomocorp As part of this initiative, Sumitomo had invested in Classiq, recognizing the Israeli company's expertise in developing essential software for quantum computing.\n\nFor the Monte Carlo simulation project, the partners adopted a methodical approach:\n\n- First, they defined the financial risk management use case, focusing on credit portfolio risk assessment, a computation-intensive process critical for financial institutions.\n- Next, Mizuho-DL FT provided quantum algorithms for both traditional and pseudo-random number-based Monte Carlo simulations.\nClassiq then applied its quantum circuit design and optimization technology to generate efficient implementations of these algorithms, with a focus on reducing circuit depth and qubit requirements.\n- Finally, the partners evaluated the performance of the optimized circuits, measuring both computational efficiency and accuracy compared to conventional approaches.\n\nThroughout the implementation, the team focused on creating practical solutions that could be executed on current quantum hardware while positioning the partners to take advantage of more capable quantum systems as they become available.\n\nThe collaboration achieved remarkable results, demonstrating up to 95% compression of quantum circuits for both types of Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining computational accuracy . Quantumcomputingreport This dramatic reduction in circuit depth significantly improved the feasibility of running these algorithms on current quantum hardware, which is limited by noise and error rates that increase with circuit depth.\n\nThe pseudo-random number-based approach proved particularly effective, requiring fewer qubits than the traditional method while still delivering accurate results after optimization. This approach addressed one of the key limitations of current quantum hardware: the restricted number of available qubits.\n\nFrom a business perspective, these achievements marked a significant step toward practical quantum computing applications in finance. By enabling high-precision calculations with fewer resources, the study demonstrated that large-scale probabilistic simulations for financial risk management may be feasible on near-term quantum hardware . Morningstar, Inc.Classiq This could potentially lead to faster, more accurate risk assessments, enabling financial institutions to make better-informed decisions and optimise their portfolios more effectively.\n\nFor Sumitomo Corporation, which had been exploring quantum computing applications since 2018, this success represented a significant milestone in its QX project .

99224120-7ece-4b81-9eac-e04716eee201	d-wave-lockheed-martin	D-Wave & Lockheed Martin: Early Commercial Quantum Adoption	D-Wave & Lockheed Martin - Pioneering Quantum Annealing for Complex Systems Verification	In November 2010, Lockheed Martin Corporation, one of the world's largest aerospace and defense contractors, signed a multi-year contract with D-Wave Systems, marking the beginning of one of the earliest commercial applications of quantum computing technology. This partnership, officially announced in May 2011, included the purchase of the D-Wave One quantum computer, along with maintenance and professional services. The collaboration established the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center (QCC) at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, creating the first installation of a commercial quantum computing system outside of D-Wave's headquarters.\n\n## The Verification and Validation Challenge\n\nLockheed Martin faced increasingly complex computational challenges in the verification and validation of mission-critical systems. These systems, which control advanced aircraft, spacecraft, and defense platforms, contain millions of lines of code and must operate with near-perfect reliability in demanding environments.\n\nTraditional computing approaches were reaching their limits as system complexity grew exponentially. As Ray Johnson, then Lockheed Martin's Chief Technology Officer, explained, "In the future, critical systems will become so complex, that problems will take too long or become too expensive to solve using even our most powerful supercomputers". The company needed to explore fundamentally new computing approaches to address these challenges.\n\nThe verification and validation process for complex systems involves checking all possible states and transitions to ensure correct operation under all conditions. This combinatorial explosion of possible states creates an optimization problem well-suited for quantum approaches, but beyond the capabilities of classical computing methods.\n\n## Quantum Solution\n\nThe partnership focused on applying D-Wave's quantum annealing technology to solve complex optimization problems related to verification and validation of control systems. Quantum annealing leverages quantum effects to find the global minimum of a function, making it particularly suited for certain classes of optimization problems.\n\nUnlike universal quantum computers, D-Wave's systems implement specialized quantum annealing, which excels at solving specific types of optimization problems that can be represented as finding the lowest energy state of a system. While this approach doesn't address all computing challenges, it offered potential advantages for Lockheed Martin's specific verification and validation requirements.\n\nThe initial implementation utilized D-Wave's 128-qubit system, which was later upgraded to a 512-qubit processor in 2013, and subsequently to even more powerful systems over the years. Lockheed Martin researchers translated their verification and validation challenges into a form that could be solved on D-Wave's quantum annealing processors, specifically focusing on problems that could be represented as Ising Spin Glass models.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation began with the establishment of the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center (QCC) in 2011, housing the first D-Wave One quantum computer. This center, operated jointly by USC's Information Sciences Institute and Lockheed Martin, created a collaborative environment where researchers from both organizations could explore quantum computing applications.\n\nLockheed Martin focused on transforming their verification and validation challenges into formats compatible with quantum annealing. This required significant expertise in both quantum computing and systems engineering to properly formulate the problems. \n\nMeanwhile, USC researchers concentrated on fundamental quantum computing research, including testing the quantum nature of the D-Wave system and benchmarking its performance against classical algorithms.\n\nThe implementation faced several technical challenges, including the need to maintain extremely low temperatures (near absolute zero) and electromagnetic shielding to preserve the quantum states of the qubits. The QCC team also developed methods to counteract quantum decoherence, which can degrade the performance of quantum processors.\n\nOver the years, the partnership continued to evolve, with system upgrades and expansion of research focus. In 2020, the collaboration was renewed with plans to upgrade to D-Wave's Advantage system with more than 5,000 qubits, significantly increasing the computational power available to researchers . USC Viterbi In 2022, the QCC became home to the first D-Wave Advantage quantum computer physically located in the United States that was accessible via the Leap quantum cloud service.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe partnership between D-Wave and Lockheed Martin yielded several important outcomes. While early results were "fairly inconclusive" regarding speed advantages over classical computing for certain problems, as noted by USC researcher Daniel Lidar . The Washington Post, the collaboration provided Lockheed Martin with valuable insights into quantum computing's potential applications.\n\nThe project demonstrated that quantum annealing could address certain verification and validation challenges, particularly those related to the problem of verification and validation of control systems. Lockheed Martin researchers also applied the technology to the design of special wave forms for RF applications with minimal side-lobes, expanding the potential use cases.\n\nBeyond specific applications, the partnership positioned Lockheed Martin at the forefront of quantum computing adoption in the aerospace and defense industry. As Greg Tallant, Lockheed Martin Fellow, stated: "For more than 12 years, Lockheed Martin has been proud to support advanced practical quantum computing, putting the technology in the hands of people who can make the most of it".\n\nThe business impact extended beyond immediate technical solutions to include developing organizational capabilities in quantum computing, establishing important academic and industry partnerships, and gaining practical experience with quantum systems that informed Lockheed Martin's broader quantum computing strategy.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on their pioneering quantum computing work with D-Wave, Lockheed Martin has continued to expand its quantum computing initiatives. In 2014, the company established the Quantum Engineering Center at the University of Maryland's College Park campus, focusing on a different quantum computing approach to complement their work with D-Wave's quantum annealing systems.\n\nThe ongoing partnership with D-Wave and USC continues to evolve, with access to newer generations of quantum processors through D-Wave's Leap quantum cloud service. This cloud-based approach represents a significant evolution in how Lockheed Martin accesses quantum computing resources, allowing for more flexible and scalable utilisation.\n\nAs Kristen Pudenz, quantum research scientist and corporate lead for Quantum at Lockheed Martin, explained: "Our new agreement allows for cloud access to the latest generation of QPUs at all times, helping drive the state-of-the-art forward, as we develop new capabilities and applications". This approach enables Lockheed Martin to continue exploring quantum applications while the technology matures, potentially leading to breakthroughs in system verification, artificial intelligence, materials sciences, and other areas critical to the aerospace and defense industry.	{LockheedMartin}	{D-Wave}	\N	{"D-Wave One","D-Wave Two","D-Wave Advantage"}	t	\N	2025-05-05 10:07:28.40814+00	2025-05-08 07:36:11.961858+00	\n[^1]: Lockheed Martin Corporation.

7df3f9c1-423a-4fea-96d7-d371fde7a0d4	google-quantum-ai-boehringer-ingelheim-pharmaceutical-research	Google Quantum AI and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical Research	Accelerate pharmaceutical research and demonstrates how quantum computing can address fundamental challenges in drug discovery by more accurately modeling molecular interactions, delivering incremental benefits today while building capabilities for transformative future advantages in pharmaceutical development.	Boehringer Ingelheim, a leading global pharmaceutical company, established a groundbreaking partnership with Google Quantum AI to accelerate pharmaceutical research and development through quantum computing applications. This collaboration, announced in January 2021, marked the first time a pharmaceutical company formed a dedicated quantum computing partnership with a quantum technology provider. The alliance focused on implementing quantum computational methods to drive breakthroughs in drug discovery, molecular dynamics simulations, and pharmaceutical optimization processes.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPharmaceutical research and development faces tremendous computational challenges that limit innovation and extend development timelines. Developing a new drug typically requires 10-15 years of research and development with costs exceeding $2.5 billion, yet success rates remain discouragingly low. A significant portion of this time and expense derives from the computational complexity of modeling molecular interactions, protein folding, and drug-target binding at the quantum mechanical level.\n\nClassical computational methods introduce significant approximations when simulating these quantum systems, compromising accuracy for tractability. These approximations create a fundamental barrier to accurately predicting how potential drug compounds will interact with biological targets, metabolize in the body, or demonstrate side effects. The exponential scaling of resources required for precise quantum mechanical simulations means that even the most powerful classical supercomputers cannot perform accurate calculations for complex biological systems.\n\nFor Boehringer Ingelheim, these computational limitations presented both a challenge and an opportunity. Addressing this barrier could potentially transform their entire R&D pipeline, reducing development timelines, increasing success rates, and enabling the pursuit of previously intractable therapeutic targets. The ability to more accurately model molecular systems could lead to more effective drugs with fewer side effects, ultimately benefiting patients while reducing development costs and improving competitiveness.\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe Boehringer Ingelheim-Google Quantum AI collaboration implemented a sophisticated quantum computational strategy tailored to pharmaceutical applications. This approach leveraged Google's quantum computing expertise, including access to their quantum processors and algorithm development capabilities, combined with Boehringer Ingelheim's deep pharmaceutical domain knowledge.\n\nThe technical implementation focused on developing quantum algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry calculations, and machine learning applications relevant to drug discovery. The partnership established dedicated research teams integrating quantum computing scientists with medicinal chemists, computational biologists, and drug development experts.\n\nGiven current quantum hardware limitations, the team implemented a hybrid quantum-classical approach. This pragmatic strategy assigned quantum processors to specific calculations where they might offer advantages, particularly for electronic structure problems and certain correlation effects, while leveraging classical computation for other aspects of the modeling process. The hybrid framework allowed meaningful progress on pharmaceutical applications despite the constraints of contemporary quantum hardware.\n\nThe collaboration developed specialized quantum circuit designs optimized for molecular systems relevant to Boehringer Ingelheim's therapeutic focus areas. These custom implementations incorporated pharmaceutical domain knowledge to reduce circuit complexity and enhance computational efficiency—critical considerations for execution on current quantum processors with their inherent noise limitations.\n\nAdvanced error mitigation techniques formed another crucial element of the approach, helping compensate for the noise and imperfections in current quantum systems. These error suppression methods, specifically adapted for pharmaceutical computations, enabled more reliable results than would otherwise be possible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe collaboration has produced several significant outcomes demonstrating quantum computing's potential in pharmaceutical research. The team successfully implemented quantum algorithms that showed promising results for modeling molecular properties relevant to drug development, achieving improved accuracy for certain calculations compared to classical methods. These implementations established proof-of-concept for quantum computational chemistry in a commercial pharmaceutical context.\n\nThe partnership has established computational workflows that integrate quantum-enhanced modeling with Boehringer Ingelheim's existing drug discovery pipeline. These workflows create a framework for evaluating quantum computational results alongside traditional approaches, building confidence in the reliability of quantum methods while establishing pathways for practical implementation as the technology matures.\n\nThe collaboration has advanced quantum algorithms specifically designed for pharmaceutical applications, creating methodologies optimized for drug-like molecules and their interactions with biological targets. These algorithmic developments represent valuable intellectual assets with potential applications across multiple therapeutic areas and development stages.\n\nFor Boehringer Ingelheim, these technical achievements translate into tangible business advantages. The enhanced molecular modeling capabilities could accelerate the lead identification and optimization phases of drug discovery, potentially reducing time-to-market for new therapeutics. Improved predictive accuracy allows researchers to prioritize the most promising drug candidates earlier in the development process, focusing resources on compounds with higher probabilities of clinical success.\n\nThe quantum approach enables exploration of novel chemical spaces and binding mechanisms that remain computationally inaccessible using classical methods alone. This expanded search capacity increases the potential for identifying innovative therapeutic compounds that might otherwise remain undiscovered.\n\nBeyond the immediate technical outcomes, the collaboration positions Boehringer Ingelheim at the forefront of quantum-enhanced pharmaceutical research. This competitive positioning strengthens the company's innovation profile and creates opportunities for scientific leadership as quantum technology matures. The knowledge and expertise developed through this partnership represent strategic assets that will continue to generate value as quantum computing capabilities expand.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on their pioneering collaboration, Boehringer Ingelheim and Google Quantum AI have outlined several promising directions for future development. Algorithm refinement remains a continuing priority, with ongoing work to improve quantum approaches for increasingly complex pharmaceutical systems. These enhancements focus on both accuracy improvements and computational efficiency, allowing more comprehensive modeling as quantum hardware evolves.\n\nThe partners are expanding the scope of pharmaceutical applications addressed through quantum methods, extending from molecular property prediction to protein-drug interactions, molecular dynamics, and eventually to systems biology approaches. This expansion follows a strategic roadmap that aligns growing quantum capabilities with increasingly sophisticated pharmaceutical challenges.\n\nIntegration with experimental workflows continues to advance, creating tighter connections between quantum computational predictions and laboratory validation. This integration establishes feedback loops that refine models based on experimental results, accelerating the iterative improvement of both quantum algorithms and drug candidates.\n\nAs quantum hardware progresses with improvements in qubit counts, coherence times, and gate fidelities, the team continuously adapts their algorithms to leverage these advancements. This hardware-specific optimization ensures that each new generation of quantum processors can address more sophisticated pharmaceutical simulations with greater accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe collaboration is exploring quantum machine learning approaches that combine simulation results with experimental data to create predictive models for drug properties and interactions. These hybrid quantum-classical machine learning frameworks could further enhance predictive accuracy while maximizing the value extracted from limited quantum resources.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Boehringer Ingelheim-Google Quantum AI partnership demonstrates how quantum computing can address fundamental challenges in pharmaceutical research. While comprehensive quantum advantage for drug discovery remains a future goal dependent on hardware advances, this collaboration has established viable pathways that deliver incremental benefits while building capabilities for greater future impact.\n\nThe strategic approach taken by these organizations illustrates how pharmaceutical companies can effectively engage with quantum computing today—developing expertise, establishing methodologies, and creating integrated workflows that position them to capitalize on each advancement in quantum hardware. Rather than waiting for fault-tolerant quantum computers, this pragmatic strategy delivers near-term value while building capabilities for transformative future advantages.\n\nFor the pharmaceutical industry broadly, this case study highlights quantum computing's potential to transform drug discovery by addressing the quantum mechanical nature of molecular interactions that fundamentally limit classical computational methods. The ability to more accurately model molecular properties and interactions could significantly reduce the time and cost of bringing new therapeutics to market while enabling the exploration of novel chemical spaces for treating challenging diseases.\n\nAs quantum computing continues its rapid evolution, forward-thinking pharmaceutical companies that invest in quantum capabilities today may gain substantial competitive advantages in research efficiency, therapeutic innovation, and intellectual property development. The Boehringer Ingelheim-Google Quantum AI collaboration exemplifies how strategic partnerships between industry leaders and quantum technology specialists can accelerate progress toward practical quantum applications with significant business impact.\n\n	{partnerhere}	{rtgrwtgrtg}	\N	{hardwarehere}	t	\N	2025-04-25 06:47:26.136781+00	2025-05-08 09:22:24.767197+00	[^1]: Boehringer Ingelheim.

d775c6d9-0887-409c-a2b1-ff6052ca84ec	d-wave-pattison	D-Wave and Pattison	D-Wave & Pattison Food Group - Quantum-Powered Workforce Scheduling Optimization	\nIn 2024, D-Wave Quantum Inc., a leader in quantum computing systems and the world's first commercial supplier of quantum computers, partnered with Pattison Food Group Ltd., a major Canadian grocery retail organization with over 100 stores offering e-commerce delivery services. The collaboration aimed to address the complex challenge of driver scheduling for e-commerce deliveries by using D-Wave's quantum computing technology.\n\n##The Workforce Scheduling Challenge\n\nPattison Food Group faced significant operational challenges with its e-commerce delivery driver scheduling process. With over 100 stores offering delivery services, the company required an efficient system to manage driver assignments across its extensive retail network.\n\nThe existing scheduling process was highly manual and labor-intensive, requiring 3-4 dedicated staff members to create driver schedules each week. These schedulers needed to account for numerous complex constraints simultaneously, including driver seniority, individual preferences, work history, and company policies. The manual nature of this process consumed substantial time and resources, was prone to human error, and often resulted in suboptimal schedules that failed to efficiently utilise the available workforce.\n\nThe scheduling problem represented a classic combinatorial optimization challenge: finding the best possible assignment of drivers to time slots and delivery routes while satisfying all constraints. The number of possible scheduling combinations grew exponentially with each additional variable, making it impossible to evaluate all possibilities manually or even with conventional computing approaches in a reasonable timeframe.\n\n## Quantum Solution\n\nD-Wave collaborated with Pattison Food Group to develop a quantum-powered solution that could automatically generate optimized driver schedules. The solution leveraged D-Wave's quantum annealing technology, which is specifically designed to solve complex optimization problems.\n\nThe team modeled the scheduling problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, a format suitable for D-Wave's quantum annealing processors. This approach represented each potential driver assignment as a variable in a mathematical framework where the optimal solution minimized a cost function that accounted for all scheduling constraints.\n\nKey features of the quantum solution included:\n\n- Comprehensive Constraint Integration: The system incorporated all relevant scheduling rules, including driver seniority considerations, individual preferences and work history, and company policies.\n\n-Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach: The solution used D-Wave's hybrid solver services, accessible through the Leap quantum cloud service, which combined the power of quantum computing with classical optimization techniques to efficiently handle the large-scale scheduling problem.\n\n-Iterative Refinement: The system allowed for adjustments and refinements to the automatically generated schedules, providing schedulers with the flexibility to make manual modifications when necessary.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation process began with a thorough analysis of Pattison Food Group's existing scheduling workflows and constraints. D-Wave's team worked closely with the company's schedulers to understand the complex rules and preferences that governed driver assignments.\n\nNext, the partners developed a structured data model to represent all relevant scheduling information, including driver availability, qualifications, seniority levels, and store locations. This data served as input to the quantum optimization system.\n\nThe quantum scheduling application was deployed as a cloud-based solution, allowing Pattison's scheduling team to access it through D-Wave's Leap quantum cloud service. This approach eliminated the need for on-premises quantum hardware while providing secure, reliable access to D-Wave's quantum computing resources.\n\nThe implementation included a training phase for Pattison's scheduling team, ensuring they could effectively use the new system and interpret its results. The partners also established a feedback loop to continuously improve the solution based on real-world performance and user experiences.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe implementation of D-Wave's quantum-powered scheduling solution delivered significant and measurable business benefits for Pattison Food Group. Most notably, the company achieved an approximately 80% reduction in the manual effort required for initial schedule creation.\n\nThis dramatic efficiency improvement translated into multiple operational benefits:\n\n- Resource Reallocation: Staff members previously dedicated to manual scheduling could now be redirected to higher-value activities, improving overall operational efficiency.\n\n- Schedule Quality: The quantum-optimized schedules better aligned with driver preferences and company policies, potentially leading to increased driver satisfaction and reduced turnover.\n\n- Responsiveness: The rapid generation of optimized schedules enhanced the company's ability to respond to changing delivery demands and driver availability.\n\nThe success of this implementation demonstrated the practical business value of quantum computing in addressing real-world operational challenges. Instead of remaining a theoretical technology with future potential, D-Wave's quantum solution delivered immediate, measurable benefits in a production environment.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nFollowing the successful implementation of the driver scheduling solution, Pattison Food Group and D-Wave identified opportunities to extend the application of quantum computing to other aspects of the retail operation. Potential areas for future optimization included inventory management, store staffing, and supply chain logistics.\n\nThe partners also recognized opportunities to enhance the existing scheduling solution by incorporating additional data sources, such as traffic patterns and weather forecasts, to further improve delivery efficiency. By continually refining the optimization model and incorporating more variables, the quantum solution could deliver even greater business value over time.\n\nD-Wave has showcased the Pattison Food Group case study as an example of quantum computing's practical business applications, highlighting it alongside other successful implementations such as Ford Otosan's manufacturing production scheduling (which achieved an 83% time reduction) and NTT Docomo's mobile network resource utilization (which saw a 15% improvement) . Stocktitan These success stories collectively demonstrate that quantum computing has transitioned from a theoretical technology to one that delivers practical business value across diverse industries and use cases.\n\n	{Pattison}	{D-Wave}	\N	{TBC}	t	\N	2025-05-05 09:11:37.567752+00	2025-05-08 09:21:30.99486+00	[^1]: D-Wave Quantum Inc.

b64fccb1-1d09-4445-abd6-6a7bae7bfe11	ibm-boeing-aerospace-materials-optimisation	IBM & Boeing: Aerospace Materials Optimisation	IBM & Boeing - Quantum Computing for Aerospace Materials Design and Corrosion Prevention	Boeing, a leading global aerospace company, partnered with IBM Quantum to explore how quantum computing could address two critical aerospace engineering challenges: the design of advanced composite materials and the prevention of metal corrosion. This collaboration leveraged IBM's quantum computing expertise and Boeing's deep aerospace industry knowledge to develop innovative approaches that could potentially transform aircraft design and manufacturing.\n\n## The Aerospace Engineering Challenges\n\nBoeing faced two significant engineering challenges that traditional computing methods struggled to address efficiently:\n\n1. Ply Composite Design Optimization\nAircraft manufacturers like Boeing use advanced materials known as ply composites to create lightweight, safe, and strong components for aircraft like the 787 Dreamliner. These composites consist of thousands of individual plies—long strands of strong material layered across one another like fabric. Each strand is strong in one direction, and building a component with the right properties requires careful arrangement of each strand at precisely the right angle . IBM\nFor a large aircraft component, these design decisions can involve up to 100,000 variables, creating an optimization problem of enormous complexity. Traditional computing approaches cannot solve such problems all at once, forcing engineers to break them into smaller pieces, which leads to suboptimal designs and longer development cycles . IBMIBM\n2. Metal Corrosion Prevention\nCorrosion represents a persistent challenge for the aerospace industry, affecting the longevity, safety, and maintenance costs of aircraft. Metal components exposed to humidity and environmental factors develop thin water films on their surfaces, initiating chemical reactions that lead to corrosion . HPCwire\nUnderstanding and preventing these reactions requires modeling complex quantum-scale interactions between water molecules and metal surfaces—a task that classical computing methods can only approximate with significant limitations. More precise simulations could lead to the development of better corrosion-resistant materials and protective coatings . IBMIotworldtoday\n\n## Quantum Solutions\n\nThe IBM-Boeing partnership developed two distinct quantum computing approaches to address these aerospace engineering challenges:\n1. Quantum Optimization for Ply Composite Design\nFor the ply composite design problem, the teams developed a quantum optimization approach that could potentially handle the massive number of variables involved in designing composite materials. They created a streamlined model of the ply composite problem, focusing on finding the optimal way to stack layers of material . IBM\nHowever, existing quantum optimization methods were inefficient, using just one binary variable per qubit. Through their collaboration, Boeing and IBM researchers developed more efficient encoding techniques that made better use of limited quantum resources. This breakthrough allowed them to run what was, at the time, the largest binary optimization problem ever handled by a quantum computer: a small version of Boeing's ply composite problem with 40 variables . IBMIBM\n2. Quantum Simulation of Corrosion Processes\nFor the corrosion challenge, IBM and Boeing researchers developed new techniques to perform quantum simulations of a key step in the corrosion process known as water reduction—the splitting of a water molecule on a magnesium surface, which initiates a chain of corrosion reactions . IBMIotworldtoday\nThe team created two innovative approaches:\n\nA new embedding method specifically designed for simulating reactions of molecules on surfaces\nA circuit simplification technique that significantly reduced the quantum resources required to run their simulations\n\n\n\n## Implementation\nThe implementation of these quantum solutions involved close collaboration between Boeing's aerospace engineering teams and IBM's quantum computing experts.\nPly Composite Design Implementation\nFor the ply composite challenge, the teams implemented a phased approach. They first identified a simplified version of the problem that could be tackled with current quantum hardware while still representing the essential characteristics of the full design challenge. This allowed them to test and validate their quantum optimization approach on existing quantum computers . IBM\nThe implementation required developing new quantum algorithms that could encode the complex constraints of aerospace material design into a format compatible with quantum processing. The researchers created specialized techniques to map the material properties and structural requirements onto quantum states, allowing the quantum computer to explore the vast solution space more efficiently than classical approaches . IBMIBM\nWhile current quantum computers weren't yet large enough to design a complete airplane wing, the successful implementation of a 40-variable model demonstrated that the approach was viable and could scale as quantum hardware capabilities improved . IBM\nCorrosion Process Simulation Implementation\nFor the corrosion prevention challenge, the teams implemented a quantum simulation workflow that integrated both classical and quantum computing elements. They developed a hybrid approach that used classical computing for preprocessing and then employed quantum computing for the most computationally intensive aspects of the molecular simulation . HPCwire\nThe implementation included the development of an embedding method specifically designed for simulating reactions of molecules on surfaces, allowing them to focus quantum resources on the most critical aspects of the water reduction process. Additionally, their circuit simplification technique significantly reduced the quantum resources required, making it feasible to run meaningful simulations on current quantum hardware . IotworldtodayIBM\nThis implementation allowed them to compute the energies involved in the water reduction reaction with greater accuracy than leading classical methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT), which has been used to study this same reaction in hundreds of other papers but requires significant approximations . HPCwireIotworldtoday\nResults and Business Impact\nThe collaboration between IBM and Boeing delivered several significant outcomes with potential long-term business implications.\nResults of Ply Composite Design Project\nThe teams successfully ran a 40-variable model of Boeing's ply composite problem on a quantum computer, which was, at the time, the largest execution of its kind ever performed. This represented a significant milestone in applying quantum computing to real-world aerospace engineering challenges . IBM\nAs Jay Lowell, Chief Scientist for Boeing's Disruptive Computing and Networks team, noted, this achievement demonstrated that "it's not if quantum computers will be relevant to our business problems, but when" . IBM The project showed that quantum solutions for complex optimization problems were more achievable than previously thought, potentially bringing quantum-enhanced aerospace design closer to reality.\nWhile current quantum computers aren't yet capable of handling the full 100,000-variable problems involved in actual aircraft design, the techniques developed through this collaboration laid important groundwork for scaling up the approach as quantum hardware improves . IBMIBM\nResults of Corrosion Prevention Project\nIn the corrosion prevention project, the researchers demonstrated that quantum computing could model the water reduction reaction more accurately than leading classical methods. By computing the energies involved in this fundamental quantum process, they achieved a level of precision that classical approximation methods simply couldn't match . Iotworldtoday\nThis enhanced accuracy could potentially lead to better understanding of corrosion mechanisms and the development of more effective corrosion-resistant materials. Given that corrosion represents a significant maintenance and safety challenge for the aerospace industry, even incremental improvements in corrosion prevention could translate to substantial economic benefits and safety enhancements.\n\nThe circuit simplification method developed during this project also has potential applications beyond corrosion studies, potentially enhancing the efficiency of quantum simulations across various domains.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on their successful collaboration, IBM and Boeing have outlined several directions for future research and development:\n\nScaling Up Ply Composite Design\n\nAs quantum computers continue to increase in capacity and reliability, Boeing aims to scale up their quantum optimization approach to handle progressively larger and more complex design problems. This could eventually enable the optimization of full-scale aerospace components with tens of thousands of variables, potentially revolutionizing aircraft design and manufacturing.\n\nThe techniques developed for efficient encoding of optimization problems on quantum hardware will likely find applications in other areas of aerospace design and manufacturing, extending beyond ply composites to other complex optimization challenges.\n\n## Expanding Corrosion Simulation Capabilities\n\nFor the corrosion prevention work, the researchers plan to continue their collaboration to investigate how quantum computing may shed light on additional chemical reactions involved in material degradation across different environments. This expanded focus could lead to comprehensive models of corrosion processes and more effective prevention strategies . IotworldtodayIBM\n\nBoeing is also exploring the application of their quantum simulation approach to the development of advanced corrosion-resistant chemicals for coating airplanes, potentially leading to more durable and environmentally friendly protective solutions . IBM\n\nBuilding Quantum Capabilities and Workforce\n\nThrough this partnership, Boeing has established a quantum-literate workforce and capabilities that position the company to take advantage of quantum computing as the technology matures.

Traditional navigation apps often exacerbate the problem by routing many vehicles onto the same "optimal" paths.41\n- **Business Challenge & Objectives:** The challenge is to move beyond "selfish" routing (optimizing for each individual car) to "balanced" routing, considering the routes of thousands of vehicles simultaneously to minimize overall system congestion.41 This requires solving a complex optimization problem involving a vast number of potential route combinations, which is computationally infeasible for classical computers in real-time.41 The objective was to develop and test a solution using quantum-inspired techniques to significantly reduce congestion and average commute times.40\n- **Quantum Solution & Approach:** Ford partnered with Azure Quantum to build a traffic optimization solution based on Microsoft's Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO) algorithms.40 QIO algorithms are classical algorithms inspired by quantum principles (like annealing) that can run efficiently on classical hardware (CPUs, FPGAs) available through Azure.40 They are designed to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems like the balanced routing challenge.40 The research involved simulating scenarios with thousands of vehicles in the Metro Seattle area, each having multiple route choices.41\n- **Key Outcomes & Demonstrated Impact:** Preliminary studies and simulations showed promising results. In a scenario with 5,000 vehicles, the QIO-based balanced routing solution delivered results in 20 seconds and achieved a 73% reduction in total congestion compared to selfish routing.41 Average commute times were reduced by 8%, translating to significant time savings across the simulated fleet.40Based on these promising results, Ford expanded the partnership to further refine the algorithm and test its effectiveness in more realistic scenarios, considering factors like road closures and driver behavior.41\n- **Indicators of Importance (Why it's on the list):** This case involves major players (Microsoft, Ford) applying quantum-inspired methods to a relatable, large-scale societal problem (traffic congestion). It demonstrates tangible, significant improvements using QIO on classical hardware, showcasing a pathway to near-term quantum-related value without requiring fault-tolerant quantum computers. It received considerable press coverage.41\n- **Analysis:** This partnership is a prime example of leveraging quantum-_inspired_ optimization for immediate impact. The balanced routing problem is computationally hard classically, but by applying algorithms derived from quantum concepts (annealing) onto classical hardware via Azure Quantum 40, Ford and Microsoft demonstrated substantial improvements over traditional methods.41 This highlights a key trend: businesses can benefit from quantum thinking and algorithms _today_, even before large-scale quantum hardware matures. QIO provides a lower barrier to entry for exploring quantum approaches to optimization compared to developing applications for gate-based quantum computers. The reported percentage reductions in congestion and commute time 40 provide compelling quantitative evidence of the approach's effectiveness in simulations.	{Ford}	{Microsoft}	\N	{ewrfwerf}	t	\N	2025-05-05 09:16:35.040295+00	2025-05-05 09:16:36.501492+00	\N	[]	\N

Extended development cycles increase time-to-market for new vehicle models and features. Suboptimal battery chemistry constrains electric vehicle performance and adoption. Physical testing requirements increase development costs and material waste. As the automotive industry accelerates its transition to electrification, these challenges become increasingly critical to competitive positioning and sustainability objectives.\n\nBMW identified material deformation simulation and battery chemistry optimization as areas where quantum computing might offer advantages over classical approaches. These applications involve modeling quantum mechanical interactions that determine material properties and chemical reactions—precisely the types of problems where quantum computers have theoretical advantages over classical systems.\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe BMW-Pasqal collaboration implemented a sophisticated quantum computational strategy tailored to automotive materials challenges. This approach leverages Pasqal's neutral atom quantum processors, which can arrange more than 100 atoms in programmable arrays to perform quantum computations.\n\nThe technical implementation focuses on two complementary applications: material deformation simulation for crash safety and battery chemistry optimization for electric vehicles. For crash test simulations, the team developed quantum algorithms that model how materials deform under stress at the quantum mechanical level, potentially capturing behaviors that classical simulations might miss. These implementations aim to enhance prediction accuracy for material responses in crash scenarios, supporting vehicle safety design with reduced physical testing requirements.\n\nIn battery chemistry applications, the partnership created quantum computational approaches for modeling complex electrochemical reactions within battery cells. These methods address the multidimensional optimization challenge of balancing energy density, charging performance, cycle stability, and thermal properties. The quantum algorithms aim to identify promising material combinations and chemical configurations that might be overlooked by conventional simulation methods.\n\nPasqal's neutral atom quantum technology offers specific advantages for these materials science applications. The processors can be configured to mirror the natural arrangement of atoms in materials, potentially providing more efficient simulations of material properties. The platform allows direct quantum simulation of many-body physics problems that are exponentially complex for classical computers.\n\nGiven current quantum hardware limitations, the partnership employed a pragmatic hybrid approach combining quantum algorithms for specific computational components with classical pre- and post-processing. This hybrid strategy delivers near-term benefits while establishing a framework for more comprehensive quantum advantage as the technology matures.\n\nThe collaboration developed specialized problem formulations that make complex materials science challenges more amenable to quantum processing. These techniques include mathematical mappings between material properties and quantum states, efficient encoding of structural information, and problem decomposition strategies that leverage the specific strengths of neutral atom quantum computing.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe collaboration has produced promising initial outcomes demonstrating quantum computing's potential for automotive applications. Early implementations showed that quantum-enhanced materials simulations could capture certain material behaviors more accurately than classical approaches, particularly for complex composite materials used in vehicle structures. These enhanced simulations could potentially reduce the number of physical crash tests required during vehicle development, accelerating the design process while maintaining or improving safety standards.\n\nBattery chemistry optimizations leveraging quantum approaches identified several promising material configurations for further investigation. While still in the research phase, these quantum-enhanced insights could potentially contribute to next-generation battery designs with improved performance characteristics. The quantum algorithms demonstrated particular advantages for modeling complex electron interactions within battery materials, a key factor in determining energy density and charging behavior.\n\nFor BMW Group, these technical achievements translate into meaningful business advantages across their product development lifecycle. Enhanced simulation capabilities support more efficient vehicle design with fewer physical prototyping iterations. Improved battery optimization contributes directly to BMW's electrification strategy, a core competitive priority as the automotive industry transitions away from internal combustion engines. The accelerated materials discovery process could potentially reduce time-to-market for innovations while enhancing product performance.\n\nBeyond these immediate development benefits, the collaboration positions BMW at the forefront of quantum computing applications in automotive manufacturing. This leadership in computational materials science strengthens the company's innovation profile and creates opportunities for continued competitive differentiation as quantum technology matures.

2c4b75d8-285a-4f84-acce-69d65d37aa68	ionq-airbus-loading-optimisation-machine-learning	IonQ and Airbus Quantum Computing for Aircraft Loading Optimization: A Milestone in Applied Quantum Algorithms	The results of a 12-month aircraft loading optimization project that tackled the computationally intensive challenge of optimizing aircraft cargo loading.	## Introduction\n\nRecent advances in quantum computing have begun transitioning from theoretical constructs to practical applications with genuine industrial relevance. A groundbreaking collaboration between IonQ and Airbus[^1], documented in a recent research paper titled "Quantum Computing for Optimizing Aircraft Loading" (Kaushik et al., 2025), demonstrates significant progress in applying quantum algorithms to solve complex logistical challenges in aviation operations. This work represents an important milestone in the maturation of quantum computing from academic curiosity to practical business tool.\n\n## The Aircraft Loading Optimization Challenge\n\nAircraft loading optimization presents a multifaceted computational challenge with direct impact on airline profitability and environmental sustainability. The problem involves selecting and positioning cargo containers within an aircraft's cargo hold while adhering to multiple operational constraints:\n\n- Maximum payload capacity limitations\n- Center of gravity requirements for aircraft stability\n- Fuselage shear limits to prevent structural strain\n- Container size and position compatibility\n\nThis optimization problem is classified as NP-Hard, sharing computational complexity characteristics with the well-known knapsack problem (Martello and Toth, 1990). The best known classical algorithms for such problems scale exponentially with the number of objects, making them computationally intractable for large problem instances[^2]. As Saunders et al. (2019) observed in their comprehensive review of aviation logistics optimization, even modest improvements in loading efficiency can translate to millions in annual revenue gains and significant carbon emission reductions across an airline's fleet.\n\n## Quantum Algorithm Innovation\n\nThe research introduces a Multi-Angle Layered Variational Quantum Algorithm (MALVQA), building upon the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework first proposed by Farhi et al. (2014). MALVQA distinguishes itself through several key innovations:\n\n1. **Reduced gate complexity**: The algorithm employs significantly fewer two-qubit gates compared to standard QAOA implementations. Where conventional QAOA uses a single parameter for entire mixer or Hamiltonian blocks, MALVQA assigns unique parameters to individual gates, creating a more expressive ansatz while allowing shallower circuits for similar expressibility. This parameterization flexibility enables effective optimization with fewer quantum resources—critical for implementation on current hardware. Unlike standard QAOA, however, MALVQA does not provide a formal guarantee of converging to the ground state as layers increase infinitely; its performance depends on factors like the classical optimizer used, ansatz design, and parameter initialization.\n    \n2. **Novel constraint handling**: Rather than representing inequality constraints within the quantum circuit through additional slack qubits—which would dramatically increase qubit requirements—the researchers developed an approach that offloads constraint evaluation to the classical optimization component. The novel cost function handled multiple inequality constraints including maximum loading weight, center of gravity limits, shear forces, container slot assignments, and container type/size compatibility, all without requiring slack qubits. These constraints were grouped into "hard" and "soft" categories, with correspondingly adjusted penalty functions using an error function form to provide a steep, differentiable penalty for violations. Hard constraints included maximum weight, total shear stress, and volume/space constraints, while soft constraints primarily addressed center of gravity limits.\n    \n3. **Enhanced cost function**: The implementation utilizes a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) method as described by Barkoutsos et al. (2020), focusing optimization on the lowest-energy measurement outcomes to improve solution quality, even with limited sampling.\n    \n\nThis approach significantly reduces the quantum resources required while maintaining algorithmic effectiveness—a critical consideration for implementation on near-term quantum hardware with limited qubit counts and coherence times.\n\n## Experimental Implementation and Results\n\nThe researchers executed their algorithm on IonQ's trapped-ion quantum processors: Aria and Forte. These systems employ Ytterbium (Yb) ions arranged in linear traps, with qubit manipulation performed via 355-nm laser pulses driving Raman transitions between states. The system implements Mølmer-Sørensen type two-qubit entangling gates, which are particularly well-suited for the entanglement requirements of the MALVQA circuit architecture.\n\nKey performance metrics from the experiments include:\n\n|Problem Instance|Qubits|Max Weight Constraint|QPU|Solution Quality|Optimal Solution Probability|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|4 containers, 3 slots|12|14 kG|Aria|Optimal|~70%|\n|4 containers, 4 slots|16|16 kG|Aria|Optimal|~40%|\n|5 containers, 4 slots|20|16 kG|Aria|Optimal|~50%|\n|7 containers, 4 slots|28|23 kG|Forte|Optimal|~35%|\n\nTo mitigate the effects of systematic errors, the researchers employed error mitigation through symmetrization, aggregating measurement statistics across multiple circuit variants with distinct qubit-to-ion mappings (Maksymov et al., 2023).\n\nFor the largest (28-qubit) problem instance run as a full optimization on Forte, the process was "warm-started" using parameters obtained from a partially converged classical simulation to accelerate convergence on the QPU. Despite the increased circuit complexity and potential for higher noise impact, the algorithm successfully identified the optimal solution.\n\nNotably, the inference runs demonstrated the algorithm's capability to converge to different degenerate optimal solutions (configurations with the same maximum objective value), an important feature for complex problems with multiple potentially valid optima. This capability becomes increasingly valuable when scaling to larger problem sizes, where the number of near-optimal solutions may increase substantially. The researchers performed ten independent optimizations with random initial parameters for the 28-qubit problem and found multiple distinct solutions achieving the same optimal objective value, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness against varying initialization conditions.\n\n## Other Related Research\n\nThe Kaushik et al. (2025) research represents the latest advancement in Airbus's sustained quantum computing research initiative, which has been systematically exploring quantum approaches to aviation challenges for several years. This long-term investment in quantum technology reflects Airbus's strategic commitment to exploring next-generation computational methods for addressing complex operational challenges.\n\nA significant earlier contribution from Airbus researchers came in February 2021, when Pilon, Gugole, and Massarenti published "Aircraft Loading Optimization -- QUBO models under multiple constraints" (Corpus ID: 231979202). This foundational work established the initial formulation of aircraft loading optimization in terms of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models compatible with quantum annealing systems. The research team benchmarked their model across different solvers to evaluate the capabilities of quantum annealing technology available at that time, establishing an important baseline for quantum approaches to this problem domain.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, Airbus continued its quantum research with the 2024 publication "QUBO formulation for aircraft load optimization" (Journal of Quantum Optimization, Volume 23, article number 355). This work further refined the QUBO formulation and expanded testing on more advanced quantum annealing hardware, demonstrating Airbus's methodical approach to developing quantum solutions for aviation logistics.\n\nThe progression from these earlier quantum annealing approaches to the gate-based MALVQA implementation described in Kaushik et al. (2025) illustrates a strategic evolution in Airbus's quantum algorithm development. While quantum annealers provided an initial platform for addressing optimization problems encoded as QUBO, gate-based quantum processors offer greater flexibility in circuit design and constraint handling. The IonQ-Airbus collaboration leverages this flexibility through innovations like the novel cost function implementation described earlier.\n\nThis research trajectory demonstrates how different quantum computing paradigms can provide complementary insights, with each new study building upon previous work while adapting to emerging quantum technologies. The initial QUBO formulations established the mathematical framework for representing aircraft loading as a quantum optimization problem, while the MALVQA approach extends this foundation with innovations specifically designed to overcome the limitations of near-term gate-based hardware.\n\nSimilar research progressions can be observed in other logistics domains, such as the work by Henderson et al. (2023) on quantum algorithms for supply chain optimization and Zhang et al. (2022) on quantum approaches to the vehicle routing problem. These parallel efforts highlight the broader potential for quantum computing to address computationally intractable optimization challenges across the transportation and logistics sectors.\n\n## Business Implications and Future Directions\n\nThe operational efficiency of air cargo operations has substantial economic and environmental implications. Airlines constantly balance revenue maximization through payload optimization against fuel consumption minimization, with both factors directly impacting the bottom line and sustainability metrics.\n\nTraditional approaches to aircraft loading rely heavily on heuristics and the experience of ground personnel, often yielding suboptimal solutions. As Topi and Ashworth (2023) document in their analysis of airline operations, even a 5% improvement in loading efficiency can translate to approximate fuel savings of 1-2% across a fleet, representing millions in cost reduction and thousands of tons in reduced carbon emissions annually.\n\nWhile this quantum implementation currently addresses problem sizes smaller than those encountered in commercial operations, it demonstrates a clear pathway toward quantum advantage in this domain. As Morris et al. (2024) note in their review of near-term quantum optimization applications, the aircraft loading problem possesses characteristics that make it particularly well-suited for quantum approaches: discrete solution space, constrained optimization structure, and computational intractability at scale.\n\nFuture research directions identified by the authors include:\n\n1. Investigation of decomposition methods to break down larger problem instances into manageable subproblems\n2. Exploration of alternative quantum approaches, such as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (Motta et al., 2020)\n3. Scaling to larger problem sizes as quantum hardware capabilities advance\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe IonQ-Airbus collaboration represents a significant advance in applied quantum computing for logistics optimization. By demonstrating practical quantum algorithm execution on current hardware for a genuine industrial challenge, the research bridges the gap between quantum theory and tangible business value.\n\nWhile full-scale quantum advantage for commercial aviation operations will require continued hardware advancement, this work illustrates that even within current quantum computing constraints, meaningful optimization problems with direct business impact can be effectively addressed. As quantum hardware capabilities continue to improve, the demonstrated scalability of this approach suggests promising pathways toward commercially relevant quantum applications in the aviation sector and beyond.\n\n	{Airbus}	{IonQ}	\N	{Forte,Aria}	t	\N	2025-05-05 07:44:00.106571+00	2025-05-06 12:47:09.616775+00	[^1]: [Barkoutsos, P.K., Nannicini, G., Robert, A., Tavernelli, I., and Woerner, S.

In January 2023, QuEra Computing, a leader in neutral-atom quantum computing, and Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, Australia's premier high-performance computing facility, established a strategic partnership to integrate quantum computing with traditional supercomputing capabilities. This collaboration aims to enhance research capabilities across multiple scientific domains by developing specialized quantum emulation software optimized for Pawsey's Setonix supercomputer while providing Australian researchers with access to QuEra's advanced quantum hardware platforms.\n\n## The Quantum-Supercomputing Integration Challenge\n\nScientific research increasingly requires computational capabilities that exceed what classical supercomputers alone can provide. As quantum computing emerges as a viable technology, integrating quantum and classical systems presents both technical and practical challenges for research institutions worldwide.\n\nA significant obstacle in this integration is the specialized expertise gap between quantum computing and high-performance computing domains. Few organizations possess proficiency in both areas, which substantially limits potential synergies between these technologies. This expertise divide is further compounded by geographic and financial barriers that restrict access to cutting-edge quantum systems, particularly for research institutions outside major technology hubs.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, developing software that effectively bridges quantum and classical computing environments demands specialized knowledge and significant development resources that exceed the capabilities of most individual research organizations. The creation of seamless workflows between quantum processors and classical supercomputers involves complex challenges in data transfer, timing, and resource management that require coordinated expertise from both quantum and classical computing disciplines.\n\nThe integration of quantum computing into traditional high-performance computing workflows has become increasingly important as researchers tackle complex problems in materials science, optimization, and simulation that benefit from both computing paradigms. According to industry analyses, hybrid quantum-classical computing approaches are expected to deliver practical advantages years before pure quantum systems can operate at scale, making partnerships like the QuEra-Pawsey collaboration particularly valuable in the current technological landscape.\n\n## Quantum Solution\n\nQuEra and Pawsey's partnership addresses these integration challenges through a multi-faceted approach centered on hybrid quantum-classical computing. The solution leverages QuEra's neutral-atom quantum technology and Pawsey's world-class supercomputing infrastructure to create a synergistic computing environment that exceeds the capabilities of either system operating independently.\n\nThe centerpiece of the solution is the joint development of high-performance quantum emulation software optimized specifically for Pawsey's Setonix supercomputer—the most powerful research computer in the Southern Hemisphere and the fourth greenest supercomputer globally according to the TOP500 and Green500 rankings. This specialized software facilitates seamless integration between quantum and classical workloads, enabling researchers to develop and test quantum algorithms at scale within a unified computational framework.\n\nThe implementation builds upon QuEra's Bloqade software package, available in both Python and Julia programming languages, which provides sophisticated tools for quantum simulation and algorithm development. Through collaborative engineering efforts, this software is being enhanced to leverage Setonix's massive parallel processing capabilities, allowing for larger and more complex quantum simulations than possible on standard computing platforms, thereby extending the practical research applications of quantum algorithms.\n\nBeyond software integration, QuEra provides Pawsey with private cloud access to its Boston-based Aquila-class quantum computers—256-qubit devices featuring unique capabilities including high coherence times and an innovative analog quantum processing mode. This remote access arrangement is complemented by expert consulting services and specialized training programs designed to build quantum computing expertise within the Australian research community, addressing the critical expertise gap identified in quantum-classical integration.\n\nA particularly significant innovation in QuEra's technology contribution is their Field-Programmable Qubit Array (FPQA) approach, which allows flexible reconfiguration of qubit positioning for each computation. This capability essentially enables customized "quantum chip designs" tailored to specific research problems, providing a level of adaptability that significantly enhances the practical utility of quantum computing for scientific applications.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation of this quantum-supercomputing integration followed a carefully structured process designed to ensure successful deployment and adoption of these advanced technologies across the Australian research community.\nThe partnership formally began in January 2023 when QuEra and Pawsey established their collaboration with specific focus on joint research projects and software development initiatives. Following this formal agreement, technical teams from both organizations conducted comprehensive analyses of Setonix's architecture and QuEra's quantum systems to identify optimal integration points and detailed software requirements for their hybrid computing approach.\n\nWith this technical foundation established, the collaborative development of quantum emulation software optimized for Setonix commenced, drawing upon QuEra's expertise in quantum simulation and Pawsey's extensive experience in high-performance computing. In parallel, the technical infrastructure necessary to provide Australian researchers with secure access to QuEra's Boston-based quantum computers through private cloud services was implemented, creating a seamless connection between these geographically distant computing resources.\n\nTo ensure effective utilization of these advanced technologies, QuEra provided specialized training and consulting services to build quantum computing expertise within the Pawsey ecosystem. These knowledge transfer activities included workshops and technical sessions for researchers across multiple disciplines, creating a foundation of quantum computing literacy essential for leveraging the integrated systems effectively.\n\nWith both technical infrastructure and knowledge foundations in place, initial research projects were launched focusing on quantum simulation applications relevant to Australian research priorities. These projects placed particular emphasis on materials science and optimization problems where the quantum-classical integration offered significant computational advantages over traditional approaches.\nThroughout this implementation process, both organizations maintained robust communication channels to address emerging technical challenges and ensure continuous alignment with evolving research objectives. The partnership structure was deliberately designed to allow for ongoing refinement of tools and approaches as quantum technology evolves, ensuring sustainable long-term value from the collaboration.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe QuEra-Pawsey partnership has delivered substantial benefits for both organizations and the broader scientific community through its innovative approach to quantum-classical integration. By combining complementary expertise and technologies, the collaboration has created value that neither organization could have achieved independently.\n\nThe integration of quantum computing capabilities with Pawsey's supercomputing infrastructure has significantly extended computational capabilities for Australian researchers, particularly in quantum simulation and optimization domains. This enhanced computational power has enabled new approaches to previously intractable scientific problems, opening research pathways that were inaccessible with classical computing resources alone. The practical impact of this capability expansion has been observed across multiple research domains, from materials science to complex systems modeling.\n\nBy combining Pawsey's deep expertise in high-performance computing with QuEra's quantum technology innovations, the partnership has accelerated the development of practical quantum applications with real-world relevance. Researchers can now move seamlessly between classical and quantum computational approaches within a unified framework, selecting the optimal computational strategy for each aspect of complex scientific challenges. This flexibility represents a significant advancement over the isolated quantum or classical computing environments that characterized previous research infrastructures.\n\nThe collaboration has also substantially expanded quantum computing expertise within the Australian research community through structured training programs and hands-on experience with quantum systems. This knowledge development aspect of the partnership addresses one of the fundamental challenges in quantum-classical integration—the expertise gap—creating lasting value that extends beyond the immediate technical implementations.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, the partnership has strengthened the competitive positioning of both organizations. For Pawsey, the collaboration has established the center as a pioneering facility in quantum-supercomputing integration, enhancing its position as a world-class research infrastructure provider capable of supporting the most advanced computational research methodologies. For QuEra, the partnership has expanded its global reach and provided valuable real-world testing of its technology in diverse research applications, accelerating the refinement and practical validation of its quantum computing approach.\n\nThe joint software development initiatives have improved the efficiency of quantum resource utilization across the research ecosystem, allowing scientists to maximize the utility of limited quantum computing time through effective pre-testing and simulation on classical systems. This optimization of computational resources represents a significant operational efficiency gain, particularly given the current scarcity and expense of quantum computing resources globally.\n\nThrough these multifaceted benefits, the partnership has positioned both organizations at the forefront of quantum-classical computing integration, creating practical pathways for researchers to leverage emerging quantum capabilities alongside established supercomputing resources in ways that advance scientific discovery and technological innovation.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on the solid foundation established through their initial collaboration, QuEra and Pawsey have developed an ambitious roadmap for future development that extends the impact and capabilities of their quantum-supercomputing integration. This forward-looking strategy encompasses multiple dimensions of technological and application development.\n\nThe partners plan to extend their collaboration to encompass new scientific domains, including quantum machine learning applications, advanced materials research with quantum simulation components, and complex optimization problems relevant to Australian industries. This expansion of application domains will broaden the impact of their quantum-classical computing integration, creating value across a more diverse range of scientific and industrial challenges.\n\nIn the technical domain, future development will focus on creating increasingly sophisticated tools for quantum-classical integration. These advanced software systems will include automated workflow management capabilities that optimize resource allocation between quantum and classical computing elements based on problem characteristics and computational requirements. These tools will further reduce the technical barriers to quantum computing adoption by research teams without specialized quantum expertise.\n\nThe partnership's educational dimension will also expand through enhanced training programs designed to build a broader base of quantum computing expertise within the Australian research community. These initiatives will accelerate the adoption of quantum techniques across multiple disciplines by creating a larger pool of researchers capable of effectively leveraging quantum-enhanced computational approaches in their work.\n\nAs QuEra advances its quantum hardware capabilities through ongoing development, the partnership will ensure Pawsey researchers maintain access to increasingly powerful quantum systems. The software infrastructure developed through the collaboration will be continuously optimized to leverage these hardware advancements, creating a sustainable pathway for computational capability enhancement over time.\n\nThe strengthening relationship between these organizations was further formalized in August 2024, when Pawsey was named as an initial member of the QuEra Quantum Alliance Partner Program. This development has created new pathways for quantum computing deployment in research applications, cementing the long-term nature of the collaboration and its strategic importance to both organizations.\n\nThe strategic alignment between QuEra and Pawsey represents a significant step toward practical quantum advantage in scientific research. Their collaboration demonstrates how targeted partnerships between quantum technology providers and high-performance computing facilities can accelerate the transition to quantum-enhanced computational methods, creating value for the broader scientific community while advancing the technical capabilities and strategic positioning of the partner organizations.	{"Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre"}	{QuEra}	\N	{Aquila}	t	\N	2025-05-05 10:32:08.985116+00	2025-05-07 07:42:44.665681+00	[^1]: QuEra Computing & Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre.

315cc55f-e58f-4d1e-8a64-f765bfd37ba2	quantum-brilliance-pawsey-supercomputing-qdk	Quantum Brilliance and Pawsey Supercomputing Centre	Partnering to deploy the world's first diamond-based quantum accelerator in a supercomputing environment, creating Australia's first quantum-supercomputing hub.	## Overview\n\nQuantum Brilliance, an Australian-German quantum computing hardware company, established a pioneering partnership with the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre to deploy the world's first diamond-based quantum accelerator in a supercomputing environment. This collaboration, announced in 2021, marked a significant milestone in quantum computing integration into high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Unlike most quantum computing approaches that require extreme cooling and specialized facilities, Quantum Brilliance's diamond quantum accelerators operate at room temperature, opening new possibilities for practical quantum computing implementations. The partnership created Australia's first quantum-supercomputing hub for research applications in computational chemistry, materials science, and logistics optimization.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nTraditional quantum computing systems face significant practical deployment challenges due to their demanding operational requirements. Most quantum processors require cooling to near absolute zero temperatures, extensive shielding from environmental interference, and specialized infrastructure that limits their integration with existing computing systems. These constraints create substantial barriers to practical quantum computing applications, particularly in environments where seamless integration with classical computing resources is essential.\n\nFor Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, a world-class supercomputing facility supporting Australian research, these limitations presented a challenge to incorporating quantum capabilities into their existing high-performance computing infrastructure. Researchers needed quantum computing resources that could work alongside classical supercomputing systems without requiring separate specialized facilities or creating operational silos between computing modalities.\n\nQuantum Brilliance's diamond-based quantum computing technology offered a potential solution through its unique operating characteristics. By utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in synthetic diamond as qubits, their systems can operate at room temperature and in less controlled environments than competing quantum technologies. This approach promised greater practicality for integration with conventional computing infrastructure while maintaining quantum computational capabilities.\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe Quantum Brilliance-Pawsey collaboration implemented a groundbreaking approach to quantum-classical integration. At the core of the implementation was Quantum Brilliance's diamond quantum accelerator, which leverages quantum mechanical properties of nitrogen-vacancy centers in synthetic diamond. These NV centers act as qubits—the fundamental units of quantum information—but unlike superconducting or trapped-ion qubits, they can maintain quantum coherence at room temperature and with less susceptibility to environmental noise.\n\nThe technical implementation focused on creating a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment where researchers could seamlessly access both quantum and supercomputing resources. This integration required the development of specialized software interfaces, scheduling systems, and programming frameworks that allow computational workflows to efficiently utilize both quantum and classical processing elements.\n\nThe partnership developed a comprehensive integration architecture that addressed several key challenges. This included creating a unified programming environment that allows researchers to develop algorithms leveraging both quantum and classical resources without requiring deep expertise in quantum computing. The system implemented efficient data transfer mechanisms between quantum and classical components, minimizing latency in hybrid computational workflows.\n\nResource management systems were adapted to incorporate quantum accelerators into the supercomputing center's allocation and scheduling framework, allowing researchers to request quantum computing resources alongside traditional HPC allocations. This integration extended to monitoring and performance analysis tools, providing researchers with comprehensive visibility into both quantum and classical aspects of their computations.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe collaboration has yielded several significant outcomes that demonstrate the potential of integrated quantum-classical computing. The successful deployment of a diamond quantum accelerator in a supercomputing environment established an important proof-of-concept for this integration approach, demonstrating that certain types of quantum computing technology can coexist with conventional HPC infrastructure without requiring separate specialized facilities.\n\nThe partnership created Australia's first quantum-supercomputing hub, providing researchers with unprecedented access to hybrid quantum-classical computational resources.

5bc389e7-9689-4409-aaea-4562dea188da	ibm-daimler-battery	IBM and Daimler (Mercedes-Benz)	Simulating chemistry for next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries, demonstrating the use of quantum computing for materials discovery in the automotive industry.	## Overview\n\nDaimler AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group AG), one of the world's premier automotive manufacturers, formed a strategic partnership with IBM Quantum to accelerate the development of next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries using quantum computational methods. This collaboration aimed to simulate complex chemical systems at unprecedented levels of accuracy, potentially overcoming the limitations of current lithium-ion battery technology. The partnership leveraged IBM's quantum computing expertise and Daimler's automotive engineering experience to address critical challenges in energy storage for electric vehicles.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe transition to electric mobility represents a cornerstone of the automotive industry's sustainability strategy. However, current lithium-ion battery technology faces limitations in energy density, charging time, weight, and cost that constrain the performance and adoption of electric vehicles. These constraints directly impact consumer acceptance through concerns about driving range, charging convenience, and vehicle affordability—all crucial factors in the competitive automotive market.\n\nLithium-sulfur batteries offer theoretical advantages that could address these limitations. Their potential benefits include significantly higher energy density—up to five times that of conventional lithium-ion batteries—along with reduced weight due to sulfur's lighter atomic mass compared to traditional cathode materials. Additionally, sulfur represents an abundant, low-cost material that could reduce battery production expenses while avoiding some of the supply chain concerns associated with cobalt and other critical minerals used in current battery technologies.\n\nDespite these promising characteristics, practical implementation of lithium-sulfur batteries faces significant challenges. The cathode materials demonstrate instability, resulting in rapid capacity degradation over repeated charge-discharge cycles. Complex electrochemical reactions involving multiple sulfur species create modeling challenges that exceed the capabilities of classical computational methods. The formation of polysulfide intermediates during operation leads to the "shuttle effect," where these compounds migrate between electrodes, reducing efficiency and battery lifespan. Interface chemistry between electrolytes and electrodes introduces additional complications that must be understood and addressed for successful commercial implementation.\n\nThese problems fundamentally involve quantum mechanical interactions that are difficult to simulate using classical computational approaches. Accurate modeling requires accounting for electronic structures, reaction pathways, and quantum effects that become computationally intractable for classical methods as molecular complexity increases. This quantum nature of the challenge makes battery chemistry an ideal candidate for quantum computational approaches.\n\n## Quantum Approach\n\nThe Daimler-IBM collaboration employed sophisticated quantum computational techniques specifically designed to address the quantum mechanical aspects of battery chemistry. The research team developed specialized quantum algorithms for simulating electronic structures and chemical reactions relevant to lithium-sulfur battery chemistry, with particular focus on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithms.\n\nVQE provided a hybrid quantum-classical approach well-suited to near-term quantum hardware, enabling the simulation of ground state energies and electronic configurations for key molecular components of the battery system. This algorithm allowed researchers to explore reaction energetics and stability characteristics with potentially higher accuracy than classical computational chemistry methods. Meanwhile, QPE implementations, though more demanding in terms of quantum resources, offered a pathway toward even higher precision calculations as quantum hardware capabilities advance.\n\nRecognizing current quantum hardware limitations, the solution employed a strategic hybrid approach where quantum processors addressed specific electronic structure calculations—particularly those involving strongly correlated electron systems—while classical computers handled molecular dynamics and broader materials modeling. This division of computational labor maximized the impact of quantum computing resources while acknowledging the practical constraints of contemporary quantum processors.\n\nThe team created resource-efficient quantum circuit designs that could effectively represent electronic structures while requiring fewer quantum resources, making the simulations feasible on near-term quantum processors with limited qubit counts and coherence times. These specialized circuit designs, or ansätze, were tailored to capture the essential quantum characteristics of the battery chemistry while minimizing the computational requirements.\n\nTo address the noise and errors inherent in current quantum hardware, the researchers implemented advanced error suppression and mitigation methods. These techniques helped improve algorithm performance by reducing the impact of device imperfections, allowing more accurate results to be extracted from noisy quantum computations.\n\nThe algorithms were tested and refined using IBM's superconducting qubit systems, accessed through IBM's cloud-based quantum computing service. This iterative development process allowed continuous improvement as the team gained insights from experimental results and refined their approach accordingly.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe collaboration between Daimler AG and IBM produced several significant outcomes that advanced the understanding of lithium-sulfur battery chemistry and demonstrated quantum computing's potential in materials science applications. The team successfully modeled key aspects of lithium-sulfur chemistry with quantum algorithms, gaining insights into reaction mechanisms that were difficult to obtain with classical methods.\n\nThe quantum approach enabled more accurate electronic structure modeling, particularly for polysulfide species involved in the troublesome shuttle effect. These simulations revealed electronic configurations and energy relationships that helped explain the degradation mechanisms limiting lithium-sulfur battery performance. By understanding these fundamental processes at the quantum level, researchers identified potential intervention points for improving battery stability.\n\nMaterials screening emerged as another valuable application of the quantum methods. The research team developed computational workflows that combined quantum simulations with classical analysis to evaluate potential cathode materials and electrolyte compositions. This screening process identified several promising candidates with theoretical properties that could mitigate the stability issues plaguing lithium-sulfur technology. The most promising materials were selected for experimental validation, creating an accelerated development pathway from computational prediction to physical testing.\n\nThe project also advanced quantum chemistry algorithms specifically tailored to battery material simulations. These algorithmic innovations focused on creating efficient representations of complex molecular systems while minimizing quantum resource requirements—a critical consideration given current hardware limitations. The methodologies developed through this collaboration established approaches applicable to a broader range of materials science challenges beyond battery chemistry.\n\nFor Daimler AG, these technical achievements translated into significant business advantages. The accelerated materials discovery process potentially reduced development timelines for advanced energy storage solutions—a critical competitive factor in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market. By identifying promising material combinations early in the development process, the company positioned itself to secure intellectual property that could provide lasting advantages in electric vehicle technology.\n\nThe collaboration also fostered the development of internal quantum computing expertise applicable to other automotive R&D challenges. This knowledge base represents a strategic asset as quantum computing continues to mature, allowing Daimler to apply similar approaches to other materials and systems throughout their vehicles. The experience gained through this project established frameworks for integrating quantum computational methods into broader research and development workflows.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, the project reinforced Daimler's position as an innovator in automotive technology and sustainable mobility. The forward-looking investment in quantum computing applications demonstrated the company's commitment to leveraging advanced technologies to address fundamental challenges in electric vehicle development. This positioning enhances brand value while attracting research talent interested in working at the intersection of automotive innovation and quantum technology.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from a business perspective, the insights gained through quantum simulation could potentially lead to significant cost reductions in battery development. By utilizing computational screening to identify the most promising materials before extensive physical prototyping, the company could focus laboratory resources on candidates with the highest probability of success. This approach reduces the trial-and-error component of materials development, potentially saving millions in research costs while accelerating time to market.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on the initial success of their quantum battery research collaboration, Daimler AG and IBM outlined an ambitious agenda for future development. Algorithm enhancement represents a continuing priority, with ongoing work to improve quantum approaches for simulating increasingly complex battery systems. These enhancements focus on both accuracy improvements and computational efficiency, allowing more comprehensive modeling as quantum hardware capabilities evolve.\n\nThe research scope continues to expand beyond the initial focus on lithium-sulfur chemistry. The team is extending quantum modeling approaches to additional battery technologies, including solid-state electrolytes and novel electrode materials that could offer complementary advantages. This broader exploration ensures that quantum insights can inform multiple parallel development tracks, maximizing the potential for breakthrough discoveries.\n\nIntegration with experimental workflows represents another key development direction. The researchers are creating tighter connections between quantum computational predictions and laboratory validation, establishing feedback loops that refine models based on experimental results. This integration accelerates the iteration cycle between theoretical prediction and practical verification, enhancing the efficiency of the overall materials discovery process.\n\nAs IBM's quantum hardware evolves with improvements in qubit counts, coherence times, and gate fidelities, the team continues to adapt their algorithms to take advantage of these advancements. This hardware-specific optimization ensures that each new generation of quantum processors can be applied to increasingly sophisticated battery simulations, progressively addressing more complex aspects of battery chemistry.\n\nThe success of the battery chemistry research has inspired exploration of quantum computing applications in other areas of automotive development. Promising directions include lightweight structural materials that could improve vehicle efficiency, catalyst materials for emissions control systems, and hydrogen storage solutions for fuel cell vehicles. These additional applications leverage the quantum simulation expertise developed through the battery research while addressing other critical aspects of sustainable mobility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Daimler AG-IBM collaboration demonstrates the potential for quantum computing to address fundamental challenges in battery chemistry research, a critical component of the automotive industry's transition to electrification.

This limited researchers' ability to make informed decisions about which molecular structures to pursue for further development.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery process for treatments targeting complex neurological conditions is particularly challenging due to the intricacy of the central nervous system and the multifaceted nature of these diseases. These challenges result in lengthy development timelines and high costs, with neurological drug discovery often taking over a decade from concept to market.\n\nThe partners developed a quantum-enabled molecular comparison application that leveraged 1QBit's Graph-Based Molecular Similarity (GMS) method. This innovative approach was formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, making it suitable for quantum computing.\n\nThe solution enhanced Biogen's existing molecule comparison methods with quantum capabilities, allowing scientists to not only determine how similar molecules are but also to understand exactly how, where, and why molecular bonds matched. This provided deeper contextual information and better insights into shared molecular traits that could potentially accelerate the drug discovery process.\n\nWhile full-scale quantum computing hardware was not yet commercially available, the application was designed to leverage today's high-performance computing power while being ready to take advantage of quantum computers as they matured. The quantum-inspired algorithms delivered superior results compared to classical methods even when running on conventional hardware, with the promise of even greater performance as quantum technology advanced.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation began with researchers at Accenture Labs collaborating with 1QBit to adapt their pre-developed structural molecular comparison algorithm and cloud-based API to include Biogen's additional pharmacophore requirements.\n\nIn just over two months, the partnership progressed from an exploratory conversation about quantum business experimentation to a proof of concept that validated the quantum computing molecule comparison approach. This rapid development culminated in an enterprise-ready, quantum-enabled application with transparent processes that provided molecular comparison results with deeper insights about shared traits.\n\nThe implementation focused on practical integration with Biogen's existing research workflows. The system was designed to complement traditional molecular comparison methods, using the conventional approach to run initial comparisons on millions of molecules and then employing the quantum-enabled application to dive deeper into the most promising candidates.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe quantum-enabled method for molecular comparison demonstrated significant improvements over existing methods, providing scientists with more detailed information about molecular similarities. The application verified that the quantum-enabled approach was as good as or better than existing methods, confirming quantum computing's potential to transform pharmaceutical research and development.\n\nAccording to Govinda Bhisetti, Head of Computational Chemistry at Biogen, the solution made it "possible to rapidly pilot and deploy a quantum-enabled application that has the potential to enable us to bring medicines to people faster" . 1QBit The enhanced molecular comparison capabilities allowed researchers to see exactly how and why molecular bonds matched, offering better insights to expedite drug discovery for complex neurological conditions.\n\nThe business impact extended beyond improved scientific insights to include significant efficiency gains. By enabling more accurate initial molecular comparisons, the solution reduced the expenses associated with screening different molecules for pharmaceutical use. This created a distinct competitive advantage through reduced time to market and cost savings.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on the success of this collaboration, the partners established plans to further advance quantum computing applications in drug discovery. Accenture aimed to scale quantum computing use in molecular matching while continuing to improve speed and effectiveness of the solution.\n\nAs quantum computers became more sophisticated, the partners anticipated even greater benefits for pharmaceutical research. The quantum-enabled application was designed to deliver increasingly valuable insights as quantum hardware capabilities matured, potentially enabling comparisons of much larger molecules and opening the door for more pharmaceutical advancements.\n\nThe successful implementation of this quantum-enabled solution also laid the groundwork for exploring additional quantum computing applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Accenture and 1QBit continued to collaborate on other classes of problems that could benefit from quantum approaches, such as image analysis and interpretation, all directed towards improving the speed and effectiveness of developing new medicines.\n\n	{Accenture,Biogen}	{1QBit}	\N	{}	t	\N	2025-05-05 09:14:54.475254+00	2025-05-07 12:53:13.235014+00	[^1]: Accenture.

Amazon Web Services This partnership represented one of the first major quantum computing innovation challenges focused entirely on industrial automotive applications, demonstrating both companies' commitment to exploring the potential of quantum technologies in transforming automotive design, manufacturing, and operations.\n\n## The Automotive Industry Challenge\n\nThe automotive industry faces numerous complex computational challenges that have historically been difficult or impossible to solve with classical computing methods. These include optimizing pre-production vehicle configuration, accurately simulating material deformation in manufacturing processes, determining optimal sensor placement in vehicles, and improving machine learning for automated quality assessment.\n\nThese challenges are characterized by their combinatorial complexity and the need to consider numerous variables and constraints simultaneously. For example, pre-production vehicle testing requires managing complex dependencies between different test requirements while minimizing the number of vehicles built. Similarly, material deformation simulation involves solving complex non-linear partial differential equations that are computationally intensive.\n\nThe automotive industry's increasing focus on sustainability, efficiency, and autonomous capabilities has further heightened the need for computational approaches that can address these complex problems more effectively than traditional methods.\n\n## Quantum Solution\n\nRather than implementing a single quantum solution, BMW and AWS took an innovative approach by creating a global challenge to identify multiple potential quantum applications across different aspects of automotive operations. The challenge focused on four specific use cases:\n\n- Pre-production Vehicle Configuration: Optimizing the testing process to perform the maximum number of required tests on a minimum number of vehicles while accounting for buildability and scheduling constraints.\n\n- Material Deformation Simulation: Developing quantum algorithmic approaches to model and numerically simulate material deformation for predicting material properties in the pre-production phase of vehicle component manufacturing.\n\n- Vehicle Sensor Placement: Optimizing the positions of sensors to maximize coverage while minimizing the total number of required sensors, critical for safety and convenience in modern vehicles.\n\n- Machine Learning for Automated Quality Assessment: Using quantum machine learning techniques to improve the assessment of vehicle parts for defects such as cracks and scratches caused by the metal-forming process.\n\nTo support the challenge participants, AWS provided access to Amazon Braket, its fully managed quantum computing service. This gave teams access to quantum hardware from multiple providers including D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti, as well as quantum circuit simulators . Amazon Web Services AWS also offered credits for participants to use these services, removing financial barriers to experimentation with quantum approaches.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe BMW-AWS Quantum Computing Challenge was organized into two rounds. In the first round, participants submitted detailed concept proposals for one or more of the four use cases. Teams with the top submissions in each use case advanced to the second round, where they were tasked with implementing and demonstrating their solutions.\n\nThe implementation phase involved teams from around the world working with the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab Professional Services team and BMW Group experts to refine their approaches and test them on real automotive industry data. The AWS team provided technical support and guidance on using quantum computing resources effectively.\n\nThroughout the challenge, BMW and AWS emphasized the importance of practical solutions that could potentially be implemented in real-world automotive applications, even as quantum hardware continues to mature. This meant that many of the approaches were hybrid quantum-classical solutions that could deliver value in the near term while positioning BMW to take advantage of quantum computing advancements in the future.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe challenge produced innovative solutions across all four use cases, with winning teams announced at the Q2B quantum computing industry conference in December 2021. The winning solutions included a range of different approaches and ideas.\n\nFor pre-production vehicle configuration, a team from Technical University of Munich and BMW Group IT developed a solution using quantum annealing that outperformed the classical state-of-the-art in certain scenarios. The material deformation simulation challenge was won by quantum computing startup Qu&Co, which provided a detailed, NISQ-ready solution strategy based on differentiable quantum circuits with promising benchmark comparisons to exact results.\n\nAccenture's team won the sensor placement challenge with a holistic workflow from user input to final result, including a framework with plugins for future quantum methods. For machine learning quality assessment, a team from Leibniz Supercomputing Centre developed a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach that demonstrated superior performance for small datasets.\n\nDr. Peter Lehnert, Vice President BMW Group Research and New Technologies Digital Car, emphasized the significance of these results, stating that "future technologies such as quantum computing have the potential to make our products more desirable and sustainable".\n\nThe business impact extended beyond the specific solutions developed during the challenge. The initiative established BMW as a leader in exploring quantum computing applications in the automotive industry, built relationships with key quantum computing experts and institutions, and created a foundation for ongoing quantum computing innovation within BMW's operations.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on the success of the initial challenge, BMW and AWS have continued their quantum computing collaboration. In 2023, BMW hosted the "Quantum Computing for Automotive Challenges" event, which brought together experts to discuss further applications and advancements in quantum technologies for the automotive sector . Amazon Web Services\n\nMore recently, BMW joined forces with Airbus and AWS to launch the "Airbus-BMW Group Quantum Mobility Quest" in 2024, expanding the scope to include aviation applications and offering larger prizes to encourage even more innovative quantum computing solutions . Amazon Web Services\n\nThe ongoing partnership between BMW and AWS aims to bridge the gap between scientific exploration and practical industrial applications of quantum computing. As quantum hardware continues to advance, BMW is positioning itself to quickly adopt these technologies to address its most challenging computational problems, potentially leading to more efficient operations, improved vehicle designs, and more sustainable manufacturing processes.\n\n\n	{BMW}	{Amazon}	\N	{"D-Wave Advantage","IonQ Aria","Rigetti Aspen"}	t	\N	2025-05-05 10:30:34.753438+00	2025-05-07 13:15:05.082496+00	[^1]: BMW Group.

9e039b07-ad28-4612-abf8-718d89bb4cc2	classiq-rolls-royce-computational-fluid-dynamics	Classiq and Rolls Royce	Developing quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics that combine classical and quantum computing techniques for aerospace applications.	Rolls-Royce, a global leader in propulsion systems and power solutions for aerospace, defense, and energy applications, established a strategic partnership with Classiq, an Israeli quantum software company specializing in quantum algorithm design and optimization. This collaboration, announced in March 2022, focuses on applying quantum computing to solve complex aerospace engineering challenges, particularly in computational fluid dynamics, materials science, and design optimization. By combining Rolls-Royce's deep aerospace engineering expertise with Classiq's quantum algorithm development platform, the partnership aims to enhance engine design processes, improve efficiency, and accelerate development cycles for next-generation propulsion systems.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAerospace engineering involves extraordinarily complex computational challenges that impact performance, efficiency, and development timelines. Traditional computational approaches for modeling fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and thermodynamics in jet engines require significant simplifications that compromise accuracy or demand enormous computational resources that extend simulation timelines. These computational limitations constrain the design space exploration process, potentially leaving innovative solutions undiscovered.\n\nFor Rolls-Royce, whose business depends on developing increasingly efficient and sustainable propulsion systems, enhancing computational capabilities represented a strategic priority with direct implications for product performance and market position. The company identified several specific challenges where quantum computational approaches might offer advantages: optimizing aerodynamic designs through enhanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD), accelerating materials discovery for high-temperature applications, and improving system-level optimization across multiple performance parameters.\n\nThe computational complexity stems from the multiphysics nature of aerospace propulsion, where fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, structural mechanics, and materials science intersect. Classical simulation approaches struggle with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and non-linear relationships characteristic of these systems. For comprehensive engine design optimization, the computational requirements grow exponentially with each additional parameter or physical domain included in the simulation.\n\nThe business implications of these computational constraints are substantial. Extended development cycles increase time-to-market and development costs for new engine programs. Limited simulation fidelity necessitates more extensive physical testing, adding expense and further extending timelines. Constrained design space exploration may result in suboptimal performance characteristics, directly impacting fuel efficiency, emissions, and operating economics—all critical competitive factors in the aerospace market. With increasing industry focus on sustainability and emissions reduction, computational limitations that constrain efficiency optimization represent both business and environmental challenges.\n\n### Quantum Approach\n\nThe Rolls-Royce-Classiq collaboration implemented a sophisticated quantum computational strategy tailored to aerospace engineering challenges. This approach leverages Classiq's quantum algorithm design platform, which enables engineers to create quantum circuits at a higher level of abstraction without requiring deep quantum physics expertise—a critical advantage for practical industrial implementation.\n\nThe technical implementation focuses on three complementary applications: computational fluid dynamics enhancement, materials property simulation, and multi-objective system optimization. For CFD applications, the team developed quantum algorithms that could potentially simulate fluid flows around engine components with greater fidelity than classical methods. These implementations aim to capture turbulence effects and boundary layer behaviors that significantly impact engine performance but are computationally expensive to model accurately with classical approaches.\n\nIn materials science applications, the partnership created quantum computational approaches for simulating properties of high-temperature materials used in critical engine components. These methods address the challenge of modeling quantum mechanical interactions that determine material characteristics like thermal stability, creep resistance, and oxidation behavior—properties essential for engine performance and durability in extreme operating environments.\n\nFor system-level optimization, the team implemented quantum algorithms designed to navigate the complex multi-objective design spaces of aerospace propulsion systems. These approaches seek to identify design configurations that simultaneously optimize multiple competing objectives like thrust, efficiency, weight, and emissions—a challenging optimization problem where quantum computational advantages might be particularly valuable.\n\nGiven current quantum hardware limitations, the partnership employed a pragmatic implementation strategy focusing on algorithm development and testing on quantum simulators while establishing pathways for hardware implementation as capabilities advance. This forward-looking approach enables meaningful progress on algorithm design and validation while preparing for deployment on increasingly capable quantum processors.\n\nA key innovation in their approach involves Classiq's quantum algorithm synthesis platform, which automatically generates optimized quantum circuits from high-level functional descriptions. This capability allows Rolls-Royce engineers to express aerospace problems in familiar terms while the platform handles the complex translation to quantum circuits. The resulting implementation efficiency and accessibility significantly accelerate the development process for quantum applications in aerospace engineering.\n\n## Results and Business Impact\n\nThe collaboration has yielded promising early outcomes demonstrating quantum computing's potential for aerospace applications. Initial algorithm implementations showed that quantum approaches could potentially address key computational bottlenecks in aerospace simulations, particularly for problems involving quantum mechanical effects in materials and high-dimensional optimization challenges in system design.\n\nWhile full-scale quantum advantage for comprehensive engine simulations remains a future goal dependent on hardware advances, the partnership has established viable algorithmic approaches for specific computational components where quantum methods might offer near-term advantages. These targeted implementations focus on well-defined subproblems where quantum computational benefits might emerge earliest, providing incremental value while building toward more comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe collaboration has successfully developed and tested quantum algorithms for materials property simulation, demonstrating potential advantages in modeling electronic structures of complex alloys used in high-temperature engine components. These enhanced simulation capabilities could accelerate materials discovery and qualification—a critical pathway to improved engine performance and durability.\n\nFor Rolls-Royce, these technical achievements translate into valuable strategic positioning and capability development. The enhanced computational approaches support the company's broader digital transformation initiative, which aims to accelerate development cycles and improve product performance through advanced simulation and design optimization. The quantum algorithms developed through this partnership represent intellectual assets that will appreciate in value as quantum hardware capabilities expand.\n\nBeyond immediate technical outcomes, the collaboration positions Rolls-Royce at the forefront of quantum computing applications in aerospace. This leadership in computational engineering strengthens the company's innovation profile and creates opportunities for continued competitive differentiation as quantum technology matures. The expertise developed through this partnership—particularly in translating complex engineering problems into quantum computational frameworks—represents a strategic capability that will become increasingly valuable across Rolls-Royce's business.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nBuilding on their initial progress, Rolls-Royce and Classiq have outlined several promising directions for continued development. Algorithm refinement remains a primary focus, with ongoing work to improve both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of quantum approaches for aerospace applications. These enhancements aim to expand the range of engineering problems that can be effectively addressed while reducing the quantum resources required for implementation.\n\nThe partners are extending their quantum computational methods to additional aspects of aerospace engineering, including structural analysis, thermal management, and noise reduction. This expansion follows a strategic roadmap that aligns growing quantum capabilities with increasingly sophisticated engineering challenges across Rolls-Royce's product portfolio.\n\nIntegration with existing engineering workflows represents another key development area. The collaboration is creating seamless connections between quantum-enhanced simulations and Rolls-Royce's established design and analysis platforms, enabling engineers to leverage quantum computational advantages within familiar environments. These integration efforts focus on creating user-friendly interfaces that deliver quantum benefits without requiring aerospace engineers to become quantum computing specialists.\n\nAs quantum hardware advances, the team continuously evaluates opportunities to implement their algorithms on increasingly capable quantum processors, moving from simulation to actual quantum execution for specific subproblems where near-term advantages might emerge. This progressive implementation strategy ensures that aerospace applications can capitalize on quantum computational capabilities as they become available.\n\nThe partnership is also exploring quantum machine learning techniques that could enhance pattern recognition in complex simulation data, potentially identifying non-obvious relationships between design parameters and performance outcomes. These hybrid approaches could further accelerate the design optimization process by efficiently navigating vast design spaces based on limited simulation data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Rolls-Royce-Classiq partnership demonstrates how forward-thinking aerospace companies can effectively engage with quantum computing today—developing expertise, establishing methodologies, and creating algorithmic frameworks that position them to capitalize on each advancement in quantum hardware. Rather than waiting for fault-tolerant quantum computers, this pragmatic strategy focuses on algorithm development and capability building that will deliver increasing value as quantum technology matures.\n\nThe collaboration illustrates the importance of abstraction layers and domain-specific tools in making quantum computing accessible to industry experts. By enabling aerospace engineers to express problems in familiar terms while automatically handling the complex translation to quantum circuits, Classiq's platform significantly accelerates the development process for quantum applications in aerospace engineering. This approach bridges the knowledge gap between quantum physics and aerospace engineering, a critical factor for practical industrial adoption.\n\nFor the aerospace industry broadly, this case study highlights quantum computing's potential to transform engineering simulation and optimization by addressing computational complexity barriers that fundamentally limit traditional approaches. The ability to more accurately model multiphysics systems, simulate quantum mechanical properties of materials, and navigate complex design spaces could significantly enhance both product performance and development efficiency, supporting both business objectives and sustainability goals.\n\nAs quantum computing continues its rapid evolution, aerospace companies that invest in quantum capabilities today may gain substantial competitive advantages in design quality, development speed, and innovation capacity.

6d2f015c-dc97-49e1-ad1b-d34f57e7cb77	openqase-quantum-industry-day-sydney	OpenQase updates and the Quantum Industry Day in Sydney	A quick stop in Sydney for the Quantum Industry Day at New South Wales parliament house.	I'm down Sydney this week for some meetings and the Quantum Industry Day being hosted at the (gorgeous) New South Wales parliament building. This is an industry event put on my my old team at Quantum Brilliance and QuEra. \n\nThe event was genuionely interesting, and had a large attendance that seemed like a big chunk of the European and US cohort that had attended Quantum Australia, as well as government and trade representatives, consulting firms and associated implementation partners, and some general business operators. \n\nI parciulatly liked the presentation from [Dr Kathy Foley](https://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/about/dr-cathy-foley), the former chief scientist for Australia, as well as a leading talent in her career at CSIRO. I say this with neither malice normercy, but Dr Foley's presentation was exponentially more valuable and insightful than those from the big consulting firms I've seen in the last few weeks of quantum and supercomputing events. \n\nI'm Australian, so I appreciate candour, and can say that Dr Foley's talk highlighted how hand-waving and glossy the majority of the quantum computing industry talks we do are. I took that especially to heart myself, and consider that a challenge to raise the bar in what we communicate and the density at which we do it. This is unsurprisingly very relevant for OpenQase.\n\nSpeaking of which, the feedback on the day was very helpful, and a few partnerships have formed, which building upon those from the previous event at Quantum Australia, are putting some momentum behind the work.

69c0bc3d-7bf1-4661-9a04-256e816f3ddf	shipping-alpha-version-openqase	Shipping the first alpha version of OpenQase	Let's explore ways to showcase quantum computing business case studies (and their associated personas, industries, and algorithms).	About those quantum computing business cases. I wrote on LinkedIn about my frustration with lacking an open source repository for this kind of information, and mentioned an idea to explore solving this. The feedback was anecdotally in agreement. While that is nothing special in and of itself, it did echo private conversations with peers across the quantum computing industry. Enough that I put a few hours to prototype an approach to tackle this. Here's the alpha release for OpenQase, a community resource for quantum computing use cases.\n\n- [OpenQase 0.1.0 (Alpha)](https://github.com/ddri/openqase/releases)\n\nThis is a simple framework that has two key things. One is a repository of quantum computing business cases as published by the various quantum hardware and software vendors. The other is a "learning path" that aims to cross-relate these business cases with the personas, the algorithms, and the industries involved. \n\nThis is very much scratching my own itch from my early days at Quantum Brilliance right up to now with OSRG. And not just for myself. Having a resource to point my various (and cross-discipline) team members to is incredibly useful. And moreso if that applies for a public audience in a way that they might choose to navigate.\n\nAs chance would have it, I recently drafted up a set of user personas on the side of some work I did for IonQ's developer experience and API product team. And I have a selection of quantum algorithms written up from my "Pocket Guide to Quantum Algorithms" book that I originally wrote for myself (another experience of creating the "missing onboarding guide" I wish I had). \n\nAs for the industries content, those I pulled from a quick literature review, a glance though some press releases, and maybe most of all, some time having a good think over a cup of Yokrshire tea.\n\nThe result is this alpha version. Here's a couple of technical notes for anyone who might follow along this project.\n\n- OpenQase is a simple NextJS application that statically renders Markdown source files.\n- Storage and deployment are both (and only) local for now.\n- The point of the stack is to let me explore how to inter-relate content and curate some educational user journeys.\n\nCheck it out and drop me a line with any thoughts or feedback (either via email or on my [post over on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hellodavidryan_quantumcomputing-activity-7301054976745746432-xVbi/)).\n\n	David Ryan		Blog	{Release}	t	f	2025-03-06 00:00:00+00	2025-05-10 08:53:22.137082+00	2025-05-11 11:58:08.237828+00	'/ddri/openqase/releases)':119C '/posts/hellodavidryan_quantumcomputing-activity-7301054976745746432-xvbi/)).':427C '0.1.0':115C 'across':80C 'agreement':63C 'aim':156C 'algorithm':25B,168C,272C,281C 'along':355C 'alpha':4A,102C,116C,341C 'anecdot':61C 'anoth':289C 'anyon':351C 'api':262C 'appli':220C 'applic':363C 'approach':95C 'associ':21B 'audienc':224C 'book':282C 'brillianc':187C 'busi':16B,30C,137C,162C 'case':17B,31C,113C,138C,163C 'chanc':235C 'check':402C 'choos':231C 'communiti':107C 'comput':15B,29C,83C,111C,136C 'content':305C,395C 'convers':77C 'coupl':346C 'creat':292C 'cross':159C,208C 'cross-disciplin':207C 'cross-rel':158C 'cup':333C 'curat':397C 'day':184C 'deploy':372C 'develop':259C 'disciplin':209C 'draft':241C 'drop':406C 'earli':183C 'echo':75C 'educ':399C 'either':415C 'email':417C 'enough':85C 'experi':260C,290C 'explor':10B,55C,389C 'feedback':59C,414C 'file':369C 'first':3A 'follow':354C 'framework':124C 'frustrat':38C 'github.com':118C 'github.com/ddri/openqase/releases)':117C 'glanc':315C 'good':329C 'guid':278C,296C 'hardwar':145C 'hour':91C 'idea':53C 'incred':214C 'industri':23B,84C,171C,304C 'inform':49C 'inter':393C 'inter-rel':392C 'involv':172C 'ionq':257C 'itch':180C 'journey':401C 'key':128C 'kind':47C 'lack':40C 'learn':153C 'let':8B,387C 'line':409C 'linkedin':35C,424C 'literatur':312C 'local':377C 'markdown':367C 'mayb':321C 'member':211C 'mention':51C 'might':230C,353C 'miss':294C 'moreso':217C 'much':176C 'navig':233C 'nextj':362C 'note':349C 'noth':67C 'onboard':295C 'one':130C 'open':42C 'openqas':7A,105C,114C,358C 'origin':285C 'osrg':193C 'path':154C 'peer':79C 'persona':22B,166C,247C 'pocket':277C 'point':203C,381C 'post':421C 'press':318C 'privat':76C 'product':263C 'project':357C 'prototyp':93C 'public':223C 'publish':140C 'pull':308C 'put':88C 'quantum':14B,28C,82C,110C,135C,144C,186C,271C,280C 'quick':311C 'recent':240C 'relat':160C,394C 'releas':103C,319C 'render':366C 'repositori':44C,133C 'resourc':108C,201C 'result':338C 'review':313C 'right':188C 'scratch':177C 'select':269C 'set':244C 'ship':1A 'showcas':13B 'side':250C 'simpl':123C,361C 'softwar':147C 'solv':56C 'sourc':43C,368C 'special':68C 'stack':384C 'static':365C 'storag':370C 'studi':18B 'tackl':97C 'tea':336C 'team':210C,264C 'technic':348C 'thing':129C 'think':330C 'though':316C 'thought':412C 'time':326C 'two':127C 'use':112C,215C 'user':246C,400C 'various':143C,205C 'vendor':148C 'version':5A,342C 'via':416C 'way':11B,227C 'wish':298C 'work':253C 'would':236C 'written':273C 'wrote':33C,286C 'www.linkedin.com':426C 'www.linkedin.com/posts/hellodavidryan_quantumcomputing-activity-7301054976745746432-xvbi/)).':425C 'yokrshir':335C

0318570f-a181-434c-8939-3140992522fe	hello-world-openqase-open-repository-quantum-computing-business-cases	Hello World! Let's talk quantum computing business cases.	What is a quantum computer useful for? It's a question that even the quantum industry isn't always sure about.	Hello (quantum) world, let's talk about being useful. \n\nOne of the challenges I had when I joined Quantum Brilliance as the first product manager was something that anyone on the business side of the industry will relate to. And that was being able to answer "what could a quantum computer be useful for?".\n\nIt sounds so simple, doesn't it? The very reason that commercial risk capital is invested into quantum computing is the chance of a commercially viable outcome. We should be able to answer this question with confidence and in step with the progress being made from the R&D side of the industry.\n\nIn reality we can't. And we don't. \n\n## Thinking about quantum utility\n\nHave you ever seen that [Bell Curve meme](https://imgflip.com/i/9thttc)? I can picture our version of it, with a title of "what is a quantum computer good for?", and either extreme simply saying "I don't know". \n\nWhats in the middle? A whole lot of increasingly AI-written chatter about the power of quantum computing to revolutionise this or that. By the time this narrative filters through scientific papers, texts, technology media coverage and hits the social consciousness (via social media), it's all just a bit... too much.\n\nLike most AI slop on the topic of Deep Tech in practical terms, these definitions and descriptions are directionally correct, but are substantively empty. And we don't really, truly, know if the various systems we are developing, across the various modalities and via various methods, are practically useful when it comes to the actual performance of our chosen algorithms in the intended problem spaces.\n\nThe work of finding this out is hard and rewarding and engaging and what many of us do week to week. And I can only speak for myself here, but it's not always easy to keep up with what's happening and changing across the various quantum fronts. The reason for that is often a result of the actual work veering towards a hyper-specialised exploration, even for those of us pulled in via relatively generalist roles. Diving deep and then coming up for air sounds poetic, but can be an exhausting context switch for various roles straddling both the business and technology of quantum computing. \n\nAnd spare a thought for the newcomers, be they business decision makers or domain experts, looking to understand where things are at right now, without having to sit through the same stories about cats, slits, or spooky this-or-that. "What can a QPU do for me", is a valid question. We need to be able to better answer that in ways that shorten the distance between question and contextual answer.\n\n## Working the problem\n\nSo let's experiment with that idea. There ARE some great business intelligence services catering to quantum computing, such as data platform from [The Quantum Insider and Resonance](https://thequantuminsider.com/data/?utm_source=openqase&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=openqaseblog), research groups like [Futurum](https://futurumgroup.com/) and Hyperion Research, and individuals like [Dr Bob Sutor](https://sutorgroupintelligenceandadvisory.com). \n\nI like these and the people working on them a great deal. But coming from a major open source company, and being influenced directly by my time with the founding CEO, I keep thinking that the kind of information I wish I had access to when I joined Quantum Brilliance wasn't nuanced business analysis, collated and synthesised by domain experts. \n\nAll I really wanted was a general overview of the market at the moment, what led to this point in time, and how everything related. I just needed the "wikipedia level" of quantum business landscape. And if that resource could THEN help point to the experts in various areas of interest, then this wouldn't be a hurdle to the other specialised industry observers, but a resource. To educate the wider market more easily doesn't detract from the analysts with deep insights. It brings more people with more specific questions (and ideally budgets) to work on more specific things. \n\n## Turning theory into action\n\nSo that's the theory. Now what might that look like? I'm not sure, but I'm going to experiment with this problem space, and see what we come up with. I don't just want to make "yet another directory". Nor step on the toes of the experts on the analyst side of things. But I do know this is a real problem I've felt, my various teams have felt, and has enough commonality in the community around me that it's worth exploring. Ideally as an open source project. Let's see how we go.

3d818fd5-4507-4bf4-b48e-a020a26f8627	openqase-aps-march-meeting-2025-nvidia-gtc-conference	A busy week in the business and science of physics (with APS and GTC)	A busy week for our little team attending the APS Meeting and Nvidia's GTC 2025.	Much like last week's post being cut short due to the Supercomputing Asia 2025 conference, tis week myself and some collaborators (including the brilliant Anastasia Marchenkova) are caught up with some other major events. The major of which are the [American Physical Society](https://www.aps.org/events/2025/joint-meeting) (care of the infamous and incredible APS Meeting) being held in Anaheim, and [Nvidia's GTC](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/) being held in Silicon Valley. \n\nAPS will be interesting for the discussion around Microsoft's current media cycle for the Majorana project. I expect there will be standing room only for the talk there. And as for GTC, I'm living vicariously through Anastasia for that one, who is invited to one of the private Q&A sessions with Jensen Huang. There's a few other things, but the cadence is pretty much the same, above and beyond meetings related to work, and our various alumni groups (be it industry or vocation), it's a good chance to keep digging into the lived experiences of the people we're hoping to serve here with OpenQase.\n\nAnd speaking of which, I've been finding time in what I call "the Qantas WeWork", aka the airport lounge that's a strangely productive place to work between flights, to apply the feedback from everyone checking out the alpha and getting involved. Thank you.

b4ce9acb-38d0-4066-8fe0-2d8609fed60c	supercomputing-asia-2025-pawsey-supercomputing	Supercomputing Asia 2025 (with Pawsey Supercomputing et al).	A week in Singapore for Supercomputing Asia 2025, and some additional user interviews and alpha version feedback sessions.	Only a quick post this week as I'm at Supercomputing Asia 2025 in Singapore for the week. While it might be accurate to think of this as the southern hemisphere version of the Supercomputing USA event, there's a lot more value and purpose for the conference beyond that. \n\nThe APAC region is a fascinating and unique area with its own set of challenges and requirements. Coming from Australia originally, but working across Asia, I find the specificity of the use cases in high-context cultures to be immensely rewarding (and challenging) to work on.\n\nWhile the major focus on my time this week is related to my work with OSRG, I will be taking meetings to discuss OpenQase, or more accurately, to discuss the problem space and gather more insights. I'm also going to spend time with the wonderful team from Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, who are an incredible supercomputing centre over in Perth, Australia, and were the first partners of Quantum Brilliance in my time working at the latter.\n\nI included the case study of Quantum Brilliance and Pawsey in the OpenQase Cast Studies section although it does prompt the question of where to draw the line between "commercial business case" and "commercial or vendor partnerships". It's too early in the project to draw some hard lines around the semantics just yet, but this will prove to be one of the interest challenges, above and beyond just acquiring and sorting and maintaining an appropriate amount of data. As I said earlier, I don't want to make a directory, I want to make a curation that moves a user through the learning journey at a faster rate than being left on their own, so that might be a north star to help work out where to draw those lines.\n\nIn the meantime, SCA2025 continues, and there's an incredible cast of speakers and attendees even above and beyond the day job meetings and milestones. Would that we all never take the community events for granted.
