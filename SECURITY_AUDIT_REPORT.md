# OpenQase Security Audit Report

**Date:** December 20, 2024  
**Audited by:** AI Security Assistant  
**Application:** OpenQase Next.js Application  

## Executive Summary

This security audit reveals that the OpenQase application has a solid foundation with good security practices already in place, but requires some updates and improvements to maintain optimal security posture.

### Current Security Status
- ✅ **Good**: Comprehensive security headers implemented
- ✅ **Good**: Sentry error monitoring configured
- ⚠️ **Attention**: Multiple outdated packages requiring updates
- ⚠️ **Minor**: One low-severity vulnerability in dependencies
- ⚠️ **Attention**: Some security configurations could be enhanced

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Package Vulnerabilities

#### Current Issues
- **1 low-severity vulnerability** in `brace-expansion` package
  - Affects: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  - CVE: GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw

#### Recommended Actions
```bash
# Fix the known vulnerability
npm audit fix

# Verify the fix
npm audit
```

### 2. Outdated Dependencies

#### Critical Updates Needed

**Security-Critical Packages:**
- `@sentry/nextjs`: 9.18.0 → 9.28.1 (Monitoring & Error Tracking)
- `next`: 15.3.1 → 15.4.0 (Core Framework)
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: 2.49.4 → 2.50.0 (Database Client)

**High-Priority Updates:**
- `@types/node`: 20.17.18 → 20.19.0 (Security patches)
- `eslint-config-next`: 15.1.7 → 15.3.3 (Linting security)
- `tailwindcss`: 3.4.1 → 3.4.17 (Build tool security)

#### Recommended Update Strategy
```bash
# Apply safe minor and patch updates
npx npm-check-updates --target minor -u
npm install

# Test thoroughly after updates
npm run build
npm run lint
```

### 3. Security Configuration Analysis

#### ✅ Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Security Headers**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
   - HSTS with preload directive
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Referrer Policy configured

2. **Error Monitoring**
   - Sentry properly configured for server and edge
   - Tunnel route configured to bypass ad-blockers

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Content Security Policy Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Current CSP allows 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline'
   // Consider tightening these policies:
   "script-src 'self' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://js.sentry-cdn.com",
   "style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com",
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Security**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is never committed to version control
   - Consider using more specific environment variable validation

3. **Sentry Configuration**
   - Currently using 100% trace sampling in production
   - Consider reducing `tracesSampleRate` for production performance

### 4. Additional Security Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Update all packages** to latest stable versions
2. **Fix the brace-expansion vulnerability**
3. **Review and tighten CSP policies** if possible without breaking functionality
4. **Add security linting rules**

#### Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Implement dependency scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Add automated security testing**
3. **Set up vulnerability monitoring alerts**
4. **Consider adding additional security headers**:
   - Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
   - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
   - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy

#### Security Tools Integration
```bash
# Add these dev dependencies for enhanced security
npm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next eslint-plugin-security
```

### 5. Supabase Security Considerations

#### Current Setup
- Using Supabase Auth helpers and SSR
- Row Level Security should be properly configured in Supabase dashboard

#### Recommendations
1. **Verify RLS policies** are active and comprehensive
2. **Review API key exposure** - ensure anon key has proper restrictions
3. **Enable Supabase audit logs** for monitoring
4. **Consider implementing API rate limiting**

### 6. Build and Deployment Security

#### Current Configuration
- TypeScript and ESLint errors ignored during builds
- This could hide potential security issues

#### Recommendations
```typescript
// Consider updating next.config.ts to be more strict in production
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Immediate - This Week) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Run `npm audit fix` ✅
- [x] Update critical packages (`@sentry/nextjs`, `next`, `@supabase/supabase-js`) ✅
- [x] Test application thoroughly ✅
- [x] Optimize Sentry configuration for production ✅
- [x] Add security linting plugin ✅

### Phase 2 (Short-term - Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Update all other packages using `npm-check-updates`
- [ ] Review and optimize CSP policies
- [ ] Implement stricter build configurations

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - Next Month)
- [ ] Set up automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Implement security linting rules
- [ ] Add comprehensive security testing

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Ongoing Security Practices
1. **Weekly dependency checks**: `npm audit` and `npm outdated`
2. **Monthly security reviews**: Review security headers and configurations
3. **Quarterly penetration testing**: Consider third-party security assessment
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Monitor Sentry for security-related errors

### Recommended Tools
- **GitHub Dependabot**: For automated dependency updates
- **Snyk**: For continuous vulnerability monitoring
- **OWASP ZAP**: For web application security testing

## Conclusion

The OpenQase application demonstrates good security awareness with implemented security headers and monitoring. The primary concerns are outdated dependencies and one minor vulnerability, both of which are easily addressable. 

**Risk Level: LOW to MEDIUM**

With the recommended updates and improvements, the application's security posture will be significantly strengthened.
