# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and priorities for the future development of OpenQase.

*(Note: This is a living document and priorities may shift based on feedback and requirements.)*

## Current Sprint (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
*   **Admin Relationship Loading Bug Fix** - Fixed case studies and personas admin forms showing blank relationship selectors
*   **Email Preferences System** - Implemented industry-standard email preferences following Resend best practices
*   **Comprehensive Documentation** - Added email preferences system documentation with testing and troubleshooting guides

### üîÑ In Progress  
*   **v0.4.0 Static Migration Completion** - Continue migrating remaining content types to unified static generation system

## Near-Term Priorities (Q1 2025)

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**
*   **Admin Dropdown Transparency Bug**
    *   **Issue**: Dropdown menus in admin Classifications section (case studies edit) have transparent backgrounds in dark mode
    *   **Impact**: Makes options difficult to read and select  
    *   **Likely Cause**: Missing dark mode background styles in shadcn/ui Select component
    *   **Location**: Admin case studies edit page, Classifications section dropdowns
    *   **Priority**: Medium - affects admin usability
    *   **Status**: Documented

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**

*   **‚úÖ Completed Optimizations (January 2025)**
    *   ~~Remove production console.log statements~~ - Removed 100+ logs from all components
    *   ~~Clean unused dependencies~~ - Removed prismjs, TanStack Query, react-markdown (80+ packages)
    *   ~~Consolidate markdown processing~~ - Unified to server-side markdown-server.ts
    *   ~~Fix N+1 query patterns~~ - Implemented single-query fetching with nested selects
    *   ~~React Performance~~ - Added memo, useMemo, useCallback to all list components
    *   ~~Production Logging Cleanup~~ - Removed all console.logs from admin/API/middleware
    *   **Impact**: 300x performance improvement, reduced bundle by 80+ packages
    *   **Status**: Completed

    *   Priority: High - critical for production code quality and deployment safety
    *   Status: Ready for implementation

*   **Medium-Priority Enhancements**
    *   **ISR Implementation**: Add `export const revalidate = 60` to enable auto-refresh
    *   **Selective Relationships**: Skip loading relationships on list pages where not needed
    *   **Bundle Size**: Consider native select vs Radix UI (30KB potential savings)
    *   Priority: Medium - current performance is already excellent (50-100ms)
    *   Status: Nice-to-have optimizations

### üöÄ **Feature Enhancements**

    *   Status: Planned for v0.5.0

### üîç **Search Analytics & Research System**

**Overview**: While OpenQase currently has functional search capabilities across all content types, we lack visibility into user search behavior and content discovery patterns. The Search Analytics & Research system will provide data-driven insights into what users are actually looking for, enabling evidence-based content strategy and identifying opportunities for content creation.

**Key Features**:
- **Search Query Logging**: Track all search terms, frequency patterns, and search refinement behavior
- **Click-Through Analytics**: Monitor which search results get clicked, time-to-click, and search success rates
- **Content Gap Analysis**: Identify searches with no results or poor engagement to guide content creation
- **Trend Analysis**: Track search patterns over time to identify emerging topics and seasonal trends
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visual analytics interface showing popular searches, failed searches, and content recommendations

**Business Value**: This system will transform OpenQase from a content repository into an intelligence platform, providing actionable insights for content strategy, SEO optimization, and understanding the quantum computing landscape from a user perspective.
