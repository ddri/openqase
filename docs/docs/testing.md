# Testing

Currently, the OpenQase project does not have a formal automated testing strategy or framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress) configured.

## Current Status

*   **No Test Runner:** The `package.json` does not include standard testing libraries or a `test` script.
*   **Manual Checks:** Some files like `src/lib/supabase.test.ts` exist, but they appear to be simple connection or environment check scripts rather than part of an automated testing suite.

## Future Considerations

Implementing automated testing would significantly improve code quality, reduce regressions, and increase confidence during development and deployment. Potential areas for testing include:

*   **Unit Tests:** Testing individual functions or components in isolation. Libraries like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) could be used to test utility functions, React components, and potentially Server Actions logic.
*   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between different parts of the application, such as form submission leading to database updates or API route responses.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Testing user flows through the application UI in a browser. Frameworks like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) are suitable for this.

## Running Existing Checks (Manual)

While not automated tests, you can run the existing check scripts if needed:

*   **Supabase Connection Check:**
    ```bash
    npx ts-node src/lib/supabase.test.ts
    ```
*   **Environment Check:**
    ```bash
    npx ts-node src/lib/env-test.ts
    ```

Establishing a proper testing suite should be considered for future development to ensure application stability and reliability.
