## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **CMS Content Filtering**: Fixed unpublished case studies appearing on Algorithm, Persona, and Industry pages. Related case studies are now properly filtered to show only published content while preserving preview mode functionality for team access to drafts. This fix maintains the static site generation performance architecture while ensuring content workflow integrity.
