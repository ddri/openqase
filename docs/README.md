# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation in Markdown format. 


## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into:
- Core system guides (installation, data-fetching, etc.)
- Architecture documentation (app-structure, tech-stack)
- Feature-specific guides (authentication, email-system, etc.)
- Archive folder for historical documentation

All documentation is written in Markdown and can be viewed directly in GitHub or any Markdown viewer.
