# Tag Input Implementation for Technical Details

## Problem
Currently, the Technical Details section in the Case Studies form has input fields for Partner Companies, Quantum Companies, and Quantum Hardware that process text on every keystroke by splitting on commas. This makes it impossible to enter multiple words with spaces, as the input is immediately processed.

## Solution: Implement Tag Input with shadcn/ui

### 1. Install necessary components
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add command
```

### 2. Create a custom TagInput component
Create a new file at `src/components/ui/tag-input.tsx` that combines shadcn's Command component with Badge component.

### 3. Component structure
- Use Command (combobox) as the base 
- Render existing values as Badge components
- Allow typing and pressing Enter to add new tags
- Add click-to-remove functionality for each tag

### 4. Update the form fields
Update the Technical Details section in `src/app/admin/case-studies/[id]/client.tsx`:
- Replace the current Input components with the new TagInput component
- Pass the array values directly instead of joining with commas
- Handle add/remove tag operations properly

## Benefits
- Users can enter multi-word entries (with spaces)
- Clear visual indication that multiple entries are expected
- Easy removal of individual entries
- Matches modern UI patterns familiar to users
- Maintains existing data structure (arrays of strings)

## Implementation Priority
Medium - This enhancement improves data entry experience but doesn't block functionality.
