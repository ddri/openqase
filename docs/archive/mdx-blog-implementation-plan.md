# MDX Blog Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing blog functionality using MDX files, consistent with the existing content management approach in the project. The blog will be publicly accessible without authentication.

## Phase 1: Content Structure Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Content Directory Structure
- [ ] Create blog content directory:
  ```
  content/
    blog/
      welcome-to-openqase.mdx
      quantum-computing-basics.mdx
      case-study-airbus.mdx
  ```
- [ ] Define blog post frontmatter structure:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Welcome to openQase"
  description: "Introducing our open-source quantum computing education platform"
  date: "2024-03-20"
  category: "News"
  published: true
  ---
  ```

### 1.2 MDX Processing
- [ ] Create blog post processing utilities
- [ ] Implement frontmatter parsing
- [ ] Set up blog post metadata extraction
- [ ] Create blog post slug generation

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (Week 1)

### 2.1 Blog Listing Page
- [ ] Update existing blog page to fetch from MDX files
- [ ] Implement filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Add pagination
- [ ] Style and optimize for performance

### 2.2 Blog Post Detail Page
- [ ] Create dynamic route for blog posts (`/blog/[slug]`)
- [ ] Implement blog post fetching by slug
- [ ] Create blog post layout and styling
- [ ] Add related posts functionality

### 2.3 Blog Post Components
- [ ] Create reusable components for blog posts
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks
- [ ] Add image optimization
- [ ] Create table of contents component

## Phase 3: Testing and Deployment (Week 1)

### 3.1 Testing
- [ ] Test blog post rendering
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Performance testing

### 3.2 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Test in production environment

## Technical Considerations

### Content Management
- Use consistent frontmatter structure
- Implement proper slug generation
- Consider adding tags/categories in frontmatter
- Use relative paths for images

### Performance
- Implement static generation for blog posts
- Use image optimization
- Consider incremental static regeneration for new posts

### Developer Experience
- Create documentation for blog post creation
- Consider adding a simple CLI tool for creating new posts
- Implement linting for MDX files

## Next Steps
1. Create blog content directory structure
2. Define frontmatter schema
3. Implement blog post processing utilities
4. Update blog listing page to use MDX files
5. Create blog post detail page
