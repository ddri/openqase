# OpenQase Performance Optimization Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement static site generation (SSG) and performance optimizations across all content types to achieve sub-second page load times.

**Current Status**: Personas optimized (98.7% improvement achieved), other content types pending.

---

## 📊 Performance Baseline

### Before Optimization:
- **First Load**: 22+ seconds
- **Subsequent Loads**: 11-13 seconds
- **Root Causes**: 
  - Server-side rendering on every request
  - AuthGate component hanging for 22s when auth disabled
  - Heavy database queries fetching unnecessary `main_content` fields
  - No caching between requests

### After Complete Optimization (All Content Types):
- **Personas**: 0.28s first load, 0.04-0.08s subsequent ⚡ (98.7% improvement)
- **Industries**: 0.21s first load, 0.06s subsequent ⚡ (99.1% improvement)  
- **Algorithms**: 0.33s first load, 0.04-0.08s subsequent ⚡ (98.5% improvement)
- **Case Studies**: 0.21s first load, 0.04-0.05s subsequent ⚡ (99.1% improvement)

**Average improvement across all content: 98.9%** 🎉

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Pattern

### For Each Content Type:

#### **1. Static Generation Setup**
```typescript
// Add to each [slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const supabase = createServiceRoleSupabaseClient();
  const { data: items } = await supabase
    .from('table_name')
    .select('slug')
    .eq('published', true);
  
  return items?.map((item) => ({ slug: item.slug })) || [];
}

export const revalidate = 300; // 5 minutes
```

#### **2. Query Optimization**
```typescript
// Remove heavy fields from queries
.select(`
  id,
  title,
  slug,
  description,
  // Remove: main_content (can be 100KB+ per record)
`)
```

#### **3. AuthGate Performance Fix**
```typescript
// Check auth requirement before making Supabase calls
if (!requireAuthForContentClient()) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

#### **4. Revalidation API Updates**
```typescript
// Add new content types to /api/revalidate/route.ts
case 'case-study':
  revalidatePath('/case-study/[slug]', 'page');
  revalidatePath('/paths/persona/[slug]', 'page'); // Personas show case studies
  revalidatePath('/paths/industry/[slug]', 'page'); // Industries show case studies
  break;
```

## 🔄 Content Relationship Matrix

| Content Type | Affects When Changed |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Case Study** | All personas, industries, algorithms (they show related case studies) |
| **Persona** | Only that persona page |
| **Industry** | That industry page + related case studies |
| **Algorithm** | That algorithm page + related case studies |

### Smart Revalidation Strategy:
- **Case Study changes** → Revalidate all learning path pages
- **Learning Path changes** → Revalidate only that page + related case studies
- **Bulk relationship changes** → Revalidate affected content types

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Target Performance (Per Content Type):
- **First Load**: < 0.5 seconds
- **Subsequent Loads**: < 0.1 seconds
- **Build Time**: Reasonable (< 2 minutes for all static pages)

### Quality Metrics:
- **No broken relationships** after optimization
- **Content freshness** maintained (5-minute revalidation)
- **Admin experience** seamless (instant updates on save)

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### **Potential Challenges**:
- **Junction table complexity**: Case study relationships are complex
- **Cross-content dependencies**: Changes cascade across content types
- **Build time**: Too many static pages might slow builds
- **Memory usage**: Large content sets during build

### **Fallback Plans**:
- **Hybrid approach**: Static for stable content, dynamic for frequently changing
- **Selective static generation**: Only generate most popular pages
- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild changed content
