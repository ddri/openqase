## Version 0.2.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)

### ✨ Features

*   **Admin CMS Documentation:** Introduced a new developer documentation site using Docusaurus, hosted within the `/docs` directory of the main repository. Includes an initial guide for the refactored `/admin` CMS.
*   **Example Docs Page:** Added a basic example page to demonstrate content creation in the new docs site.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Docs URL Structure:** Corrected the URL path for documentation pages to remove the duplicate `/docs/docs/` segment. Pages are now accessible at `/docs/[slug]`.
*   **Docs Landing Page:** Replaced the default Docusaurus landing page with a redirect to the primary CMS guide.

### 🔧 Changes & Improvements

*   Configured Docusaurus project basics (`title`, `baseUrl`, repository links).
*   Updated root `.gitignore` to exclude Docusaurus build artifacts.
