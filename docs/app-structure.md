# Application Structure

The OpenQase project follows a structure typical for modern Next.js applications, leveraging the App Router.

## Root Directory

The root directory contains configuration files, the main application source (`src/`), documentation (`docs/`), Supabase configuration (`supabase/`), scripts (`scripts/`), and other project-level items.

*   `src/`: Contains the core application code.
*   `docs/`: Contains markdown documentation files for GitHub.
*   `supabase/`: Contains Supabase CLI configuration and migrations.
*   `scripts/`: Contains custom Node.js/TypeScript utility scripts for tasks like data migration or setup.
*   `public/`: Static assets directly served by Next.js.
*   `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration file.
*   `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
*   `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the main application.
*   `.env.local`: Local environment variables (Supabase keys, etc.). **Never commit this file.**

## `src/` Directory

This is where the primary application logic resides.

*   `src/app/`: Core of the Next.js App Router implementation. Contains layouts, pages, API routes, and specific feature routes.
*   `src/components/`: Shared React components used throughout the application, likely including UI elements built with shadcn/ui.
*   `src/lib/`: Core library code, utilities, and integrations. Notably contains Supabase client helpers (`supabase-*.ts`), API clients, type definitions, and validation logic.
*   `src/utils/`: Additional utility functions. *(Consider consolidating relevant utilities into `src/lib/` if appropriate)*.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
*   `src/contexts/`: React Context providers.
*   `src/types/`: Application-specific TypeScript type definitions (though some might also be in `src/lib/types.ts`).
*   `src/middleware.ts`: Next.js middleware, primarily handling authentication and route protection.
*   `src/config/`: Application-level configuration constants or settings.

## `src/app/` Directory

Defines the application's routes and views.

*   `layout.tsx`: Root layout component wrapping all pages.
*   `page.tsx`: The application's homepage component.
*   `globals.css`: Global CSS styles.
*   `admin/`: Contains all routes and components for the Content Management System.
*   `api/`: Contains API route handlers. *(Note: These might be partially or fully deprecated in favor of Server Actions)*.
*   `auth/`: Routes related to user authentication (login, signup, callback).
*   `blog/`, `case-study/`, `paths/`, `profile/`, `contact/`, `about/`: Public-facing routes for different content types or application features.

This structure separates concerns, placing routing and core page logic in `src/app/`, reusable UI elements in `src/components/`, shared business logic and utilities in `src/lib/`, and configuration at the root or within `src/config/`. # Server & Client Components

This project leverages the React Server Components (RSC) architecture introduced with the Next.js App Router. This allows for a hybrid approach where components can be rendered either on the server or the client, optimizing performance and developer experience.

## Server Components (Default)

*   **Definition:** Components defined in `.tsx` or `.jsx` files within the `src/app/` directory are **Server Components by default**. They do *not* need the `"use server";` directive (that's for Server Actions).
*   **Rendering:** Rendered entirely on the server. Their code is never sent to the client bundle.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Can directly access server-side resources (databases, file systems, environment variables).
    *   Can use `async/await` for data fetching directly within the component.
    *   Ideal for static content display and initial data loading.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Cannot use React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`.
    *   Cannot use browser-only APIs (e.g., `window`, `localStorage`).
    *   Cannot have interactive event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.).
*   **Example Usage (OpenQase):**
    *   `page.tsx` files (e.g., `src/app/admin/blog-posts/page.tsx`, `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`) are typically Server Components responsible for fetching initial list or item data using helpers like `getSupabaseServerClient`.
    *   Layout components (`layout.tsx`) are often Server Components.

## Client Components

*   **Definition:** To make a component interactive and allow it to run in the browser, you must explicitly mark it as a Client Component using the **`"use client";` directive** at the very top of the file.
*   **Rendering:** Initially rendered on the server (for SSR/SSG), then "hydrated" and made interactive on the client. Their code *is* included in the client bundle.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Can use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.).
    *   Can use browser APIs.
    *   Can have interactive event handlers.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Cannot directly access server-side resources (must fetch data via API calls or Server Actions).
    *   Cannot use `async/await` directly for data fetching in the component body (use `useEffect` or standard React state).
*   **Example Usage (OpenQase):**
    *   Components containing forms with state and event handlers, like the admin edit forms (`src/app/admin/[content-type]/[id]/client.tsx`).
    *   Components using standard React hooks for client-side state management.
    *   Any component requiring `useState`, `useEffect`, or browser interaction.

## Relationship & Interaction

*   Server Components can import and render Client Components.
*   Client Components **cannot** directly import Server Components. They can, however, receive Server Components as props (e.g., via the `children` prop).
*   Data fetching is often done in Server Components and the data is passed down as props to Client Components.
*   For mutations or actions triggered by user interaction in Client Components, **Server Actions** are used. Client Components invoke Server Actions (defined in separate files, often with `"use server";`), which execute securely on the server.

This separation allows the project to keep interactive JavaScript bundles smaller while leveraging the server for efficient data fetching and secure operations.
