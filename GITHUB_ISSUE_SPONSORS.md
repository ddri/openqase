# Feature: Add Sponsor Section to Homepage

## Summary
Implement a sponsor section on the homepage to support site sustainability through paid sponsorships while maintaining the open-source community ethos.

## Description
Add a new section between "Open Source & Community Driven" and the footer that displays sponsor cards in a style consistent with the existing design system. This will enable monetization through sponsorships while keeping content freely accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sponsor section displays between community section and footer
- [ ] 3-column responsive grid layout matching existing card patterns
- [ ] Dark-themed cards consistent with current design
- [ ] Support for 3 sponsorship tiers (Primary, Supporting, Community)
- [ ] Sponsor data manageable without code changes
- [ ] No negative impact on page performance
- [ ] Clear sponsor labeling for transparency
- [ ] Mobile responsive (stacks vertically)
- [ ] Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Design Requirements
- **Section Title**: "Supported By" or "Our Sponsors"
- **Card Layout**: 3 columns on desktop, stack on mobile
- **Visual Style**: Dark cards matching existing theme
- **Content**: Logo, name, description, link to sponsor
- **Tiers**: Visual differentiation for sponsorship levels

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: MVP
- [ ] Create SponsorCard component
- [ ] Create SponsorSection component
- [ ] Add static sponsor data (JSON or hardcoded)
- [ ] Integrate into homepage
- [ ] Style to match existing design system

### Phase 2: CMS Integration
- [ ] Create sponsors table in Supabase
- [ ] Add sponsor management to admin panel
- [ ] Implement active/inactive status
- [ ] Add date-based visibility

### Phase 3: Enhancements
- [ ] Sponsor analytics tracking
- [ ] A/B testing capabilities
- [ ] Automated expiration handling
- [ ] ROI reporting

## Data Model
```typescript
interface Sponsor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  tier: 'primary' | 'supporting' | 'community';
  logo: string;
  description?: string;
  url: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

## Files to Modify
- [ ] `app/page.tsx` - Add SponsorSection component
- [ ] `components/sponsors/SponsorSection.tsx` - New component
- [ ] `components/sponsors/SponsorCard.tsx` - New component  
- [ ] `lib/sponsors.ts` - Sponsor data/fetching logic
- [ ] `styles/` - Any new styles needed

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Performance testing (Lighthouse)
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README with sponsor information
- [ ] Create sponsorship packages document
- [ ] Document sponsor management process
- [ ] Add to component library docs

## Dependencies
- No new package dependencies required
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS and design system
- Leverages existing Supabase setup (Phase 2)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Community perception of commercialization
  - **Mitigation**: Clear transparency, maintain free access, align with values
- **Risk**: Performance impact from images
  - **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, optimized formats, CDN usage
- **Risk**: Sponsor churn
  - **Mitigation**: Attractive packages, clear ROI, good relationships

## Success Metrics
- Sponsor acquisition rate
- Click-through rate to sponsor sites  
- User sentiment (no negative impact)
- Revenue generation targets met
- Page performance maintained

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1 (MVP): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (CMS): 3-4 days
- Phase 3 (Enhancements): 1 week

## Labels
`enhancement` `homepage` `monetization` `sponsors` `ui/ux`

## Questions/Discussion
1. Should sponsors appear on other pages beyond homepage?
2. How many sponsors maximum should we display?
3. Should we offer industry-exclusive sponsorships?
4. What are the sponsorship package prices?
5. Approval process for new sponsors?
