# Blog Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements a blog system using MDX files, consistent with our existing content management approach. The blog is publicly accessible and doesn't require authentication.

## Changes

### Content Structure
- Created a `content/blog` directory for blog posts
- Added two sample blog posts with proper frontmatter structure
- Defined a consistent frontmatter schema for blog posts

### Type Definitions
- Updated `src/lib/types.ts` to include blog posts
- Added a `BlogPost` interface and type guard
- Added 'blog' to the `ContentType` type

### Frontend Implementation
- Updated the blog listing page to fetch and display blog posts from MDX files
- Created a dynamic route for individual blog posts (`/blog/[slug]`)
- Added not-found pages for non-existent or unpublished posts
- Implemented filtering for published posts

### Documentation
- Created a comprehensive blog author guide in `docs/blog-author-guide.md`
- Documented the process for creating, editing, and managing blog posts

## Testing
- Tested the blog listing page with sample posts
- Verified that individual blog posts render correctly
- Confirmed that unpublished posts return 404
- Tested the not-found pages

## Screenshots
[Add screenshots of the blog listing page and a sample blog post]
