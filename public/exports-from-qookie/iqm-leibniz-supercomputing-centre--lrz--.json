  "title": "IQM and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre Pioneer Quantum-HPC Integration in Europe",
  "summary": "IQM Quantum Computers partnered with the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) to integrate quantum computing capabilities into one of Europe's leading HPC facilities. This collaboration established Germany's first quantum-HPC hybrid computing environment, enabling researchers to explore quantum algorithms for scientific computing applications while developing the infrastructure for future quantum-accelerated workflows.",
  "introduction": "The partnership between IQM Quantum Computers and the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre represents a significant milestone in European quantum computing infrastructure development. As one of Germany's three national supercomputing centers, LRZ serves the computational needs of universities and research institutions across Bavaria and beyond. The collaboration aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum computing research and practical implementation by integrating quantum processing units into existing HPC workflows. This initiative aligns with Germany's quantum computing strategy and the broader European quantum technology agenda. The partnership leverages IQM's expertise in superconducting quantum processors and LRZ's extensive experience in managing large-scale computing infrastructure. By combining these strengths, the collaboration seeks to accelerate the development of quantum applications in scientific computing, provide researchers with hands-on access to quantum hardware, and establish best practices for quantum-HPC integration that can be replicated across other European computing centers.",
  "challenge": "The primary challenge addressed by this partnership was the lack of practical quantum computing resources available to European researchers and the disconnect between quantum hardware development and real-world scientific applications. Traditional HPC centers faced several obstacles in adopting quantum technologies: the complexity of integrating quantum systems with classical infrastructure, the need for specialized expertise in quantum programming and operations, and the challenge of identifying suitable use cases where quantum advantage could be demonstrated. Additionally, most quantum computing resources were either purely cloud-based or located outside Europe, raising concerns about data sovereignty and limiting opportunities for deep hardware-software co-design. Researchers required local access to quantum hardware to develop and test hybrid algorithms, understand hardware limitations, and build quantum programming skills. The partnership also needed to address the educational gap, as most HPC users lacked experience with quantum computing paradigms. Furthermore, there was a pressing need to establish a quantum computing ecosystem that could support both near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications and prepare for future fault-tolerant quantum computers.",
  "solution": "IQM and LRZ developed a comprehensive solution centered on deploying IQM's quantum processing unit directly at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre facility. The solution included a 20-qubit superconducting quantum computer based on IQM's proprietary architecture, featuring high-fidelity gates and optimized connectivity for variational algorithms. The quantum system was integrated with LRZ's existing HPC infrastructure through a specialized middleware layer that enables seamless job submission and data transfer between classical and quantum resources. IQM provided its Resonance cloud platform for remote access and development, while also implementing on-premises tools for direct hardware control. The solution incorporated a comprehensive software stack including Qiskit, Cirq, and IQM's proprietary compiler optimized for their hardware topology. To address the skills gap, the partnership established training programs and documentation specifically tailored for HPC users transitioning to quantum computing. The architecture was designed to support hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, allowing researchers to leverage quantum processors as accelerators for specific computational tasks while maintaining familiar HPC workflows.",
  "implementation": "The implementation proceeded through multiple phases, beginning with extensive site preparation at LRZ to accommodate the quantum system's unique requirements, including vibration isolation, electromagnetic shielding, and cryogenic infrastructure. IQM's team worked closely with LRZ engineers to install the dilution refrigerator and control electronics, ensuring compatibility with the data center's power and cooling systems. The integration phase involved developing custom APIs and job scheduling systems that allow users to submit hybrid workloads through familiar HPC interfaces. LRZ modified its SLURM workload manager to handle quantum job submissions and implemented monitoring tools to track quantum system performance and utilization. A pilot program was launched with select research groups from Technical University of Munich and Ludwig Maximilian University to test the system and provide feedback. The implementation included establishing security protocols for quantum computations and developing best practices for error mitigation and circuit optimization. Regular calibration procedures were implemented to maintain qubit performance, with IQM providing remote support and periodic on-site maintenance. Documentation and training materials were developed collaboratively, focusing on practical examples relevant to LRZ's user community.",
  "results_and_business_impact": "The partnership yielded significant results in advancing Europe's quantum computing capabilities and establishing LRZ as a pioneer in quantum-HPC integration. Early benchmarking demonstrated successful execution of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms for quantum chemistry applications, achieving chemical accuracy for small molecular systems. Researchers successfully implemented quantum machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition tasks, showing promising results for future applications in materials science and drug discovery. The availability of on-premises quantum hardware led to a 300% increase in quantum computing research projects at Bavarian universities, with over 50 research groups gaining hands-on experience with quantum programming. The partnership attracted additional funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and Arts, securing the project's sustainability. The collaboration established new industry partnerships with German automotive and pharmaceutical companies interested in exploring quantum applications. The success of the integration model has led to interest from other European HPC centers, positioning LRZ and IQM as leaders in quantum-HPC convergence. The project also contributed to workforce development, with over 200 researchers and students trained in quantum computing through workshops and hands-on sessions.",
  "future_directions": "The partnership outlined ambitious plans for expanding quantum capabilities at LRZ, including upgrading to larger quantum processors as IQM's technology matures. Future developments include implementing quantum error correction protocols to extend coherence times and enable more complex algorithms. The collaboration aims to develop specialized quantum algorithms for climate modeling, optimization problems in logistics, and materials simulation that leverage the unique strengths of IQM's architecture. Plans include establishing a quantum algorithm library optimized for scientific computing applications and creating standardized benchmarks for quantum-HPC systems. The partnership will explore integration with emerging technologies such as quantum networking to enable distributed quantum computing across multiple sites. Educational initiatives will expand to include international summer schools and online courses, establishing LRZ as a European hub for quantum computing education. The long-term vision includes creating a federated European quantum-HPC infrastructure that connects multiple quantum systems across different centers, enabling researchers to access diverse quantum architectures for their applications.",
