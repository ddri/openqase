# Stark-Inspired Design System Implementation

## Final Implementation Summary

### 1. Shadow System (Actually Visible)
```css
/* Before - Too subtle */
--shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)

/* After - Proper elevation like Stark */
--shadow-sm: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
--shadow-md: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
```

### 2. Strategic Use of Accent Color
**Before:** Yellow everywhere (icons, numbers, links, hovers)
**After:** Yellow only for primary CTAs and key hover states
- Icons: `text-muted-foreground` (gray)
- Numbers: `text-foreground` (black, bold for emphasis)
- Links: `text-muted-foreground` with hover to `text-foreground`

### 3. Proper Card Definition
- All cards have `rounded-lg` corners
- All cards have `border border-border`
- All cards have appropriate shadows (`shadow-sm` or `shadow-md`)
- Hover states increase shadow depth, not translate

### 4. Improved Spacing
- Sections: `py-24 px-6` (was `py-20 px-4`)
- Grid gaps: `gap-4 sm:gap-6` (was `gap-3 sm:gap-4`)
- Card padding: `p-4 sm:p-5` for stats, `p-6` for content

### 5. Visual Hierarchy
```
Level 0: Background (cream)
Level 1: Cards with shadow-sm (stats, minor content)
Level 2: Cards with shadow-md (major content, search)
Level 3: Hover states with shadow-lg
```

## Key Design Principles Applied

### From Stark:
- High contrast (pure black on cream)
- Visible shadows for real elevation
- Borders + shadows together for definition
- Strategic accent color usage

### From Material Design:
- Systematic shadow progression
- Consistent border radius
- Elevation indicates importance
- Smooth transitions on hover

## Color Usage Guidelines

### Primary (Yellow):
- Primary button backgrounds
- Key hover states (sparingly)
- Active navigation states

### Text Colors:
- Primary text: Pure black
- Secondary text: Dark gray
- Tertiary text: Medium gray

### Icons:
- Default: Muted gray
- Active/hover: Black or yellow (contextual)

## Result
A professional, accessible design system that:
- Matches Stark's accessibility standards
- Incorporates Material's systematic approach
- Uses yellow strategically, not everywhere
- Creates clear visual hierarchy through shadows and borders
