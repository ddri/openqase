### **4. IonQ & Oak Ridge National Lab: Quantum for Power Grid Modernization**

**Partners**: IonQ (USA), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA)  
**Objective**: Optimize U.S. power grid stability using quantum hybrid algorithms.  
**Technology**:

- IonQ’s 35-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer integrated with ORNL’s Summit supercomputer.  
    **Outcome**:
    
- Demonstrated 40% faster anomaly detection in grid simulations compared to classical methods[7](https://ionq.com/news/oak-ridge-national-laboratory-collaborates-with-ionq-to-drive-critical).
    
- Supported by the DOE’s $65M Grid Modernization Initiative.
