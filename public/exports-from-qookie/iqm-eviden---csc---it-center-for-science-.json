  "title": "IQM, Eviden, and CSC Partnership: Advancing European Quantum Computing Infrastructure",
  "summary": "IQM Quantum Computers partnered with Eviden (an Atos business) and CSC - IT Center for Science to deliver and integrate quantum computing systems into Finland's national supercomputing infrastructure. This collaboration aims to establish Europe as a leader in quantum computing by combining IQM's quantum hardware expertise with Eviden's system integration capabilities and CSC's high-performance computing infrastructure.",
  "introduction": "The partnership between IQM Quantum Computers, Eviden, and CSC - IT Center for Science represents a significant milestone in European quantum computing development. IQM, a leading European quantum computer manufacturer based in Finland, joined forces with Eviden, a global leader in advanced computing, and CSC, Finland's national IT center for science, to create an integrated quantum-classical computing environment. This collaboration emerged from the growing need for practical quantum computing resources accessible to researchers and industry partners across Europe. The partnership leverages IQM's expertise in superconducting quantum processors, Eviden's extensive experience in high-performance computing integration, and CSC's role as a premier research computing facility. Together, these organizations work to democratize access to quantum computing resources while fostering the development of quantum algorithms and applications. The initiative aligns with broader European quantum initiatives and the EU's strategic goal of achieving quantum sovereignty by developing indigenous quantum computing capabilities.",
  "challenge": "The partnership addressed several critical challenges facing the quantum computing ecosystem in Europe. First, there was a significant gap between quantum hardware development and practical accessibility for researchers and businesses. Most quantum systems remained isolated in specialized laboratories, limiting their utility for real-world applications. Second, the integration of quantum computers with existing classical high-performance computing infrastructure posed substantial technical challenges, including the need for specialized cooling systems, control electronics, and software interfaces. Third, Europe faced the risk of falling behind in the global quantum computing race, with major investments from the United States and China threatening to dominate the field. Additionally, there was a shortage of quantum programming expertise and limited understanding of how to effectively utilize quantum-classical hybrid algorithms. The partnership also needed to address the challenge of creating a sustainable quantum computing ecosystem that could support both academic research and industrial applications. Finally, ensuring reliable operation of quantum systems in a production environment, rather than just laboratory settings, required new approaches to system design, maintenance, and user support.",
  "solution": "The partnership developed a comprehensive quantum computing solution centered around IQM's superconducting quantum processors integrated into CSC's LUMI supercomputer environment through Eviden's expertise. IQM provided its proprietary quantum processing units (QPUs) based on their scalable architecture, featuring high-fidelity quantum gates and optimized for near-term quantum algorithms. Eviden contributed its Quantum Learning Machine (QLM) software platform and integration expertise, creating a seamless interface between the quantum and classical computing resources. The solution includes a full software stack enabling users to develop, test, and run quantum algorithms through familiar programming frameworks like Qiskit and Cirq. The system architecture allows for hybrid quantum-classical workflows, where quantum processors handle specific computational tasks while classical systems manage data preprocessing, optimization loops, and post-processing. Special attention was paid to creating user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation to lower the barrier to entry for quantum computing newcomers. The solution also incorporated advanced error mitigation techniques and quantum circuit optimization to maximize the utility of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.",
  "implementation": "The implementation process began with extensive planning and infrastructure preparation at CSC's facilities in Kajaani, Finland. The team first established the necessary cryogenic infrastructure to maintain the quantum processors at near-absolute zero temperatures required for superconducting qubits. Eviden led the system integration effort, connecting IQM's quantum processors to the classical computing infrastructure through high-speed, low-latency interfaces. The implementation included developing custom middleware to manage job scheduling between quantum and classical resources, ensuring efficient resource utilization. A phased deployment approach was adopted, starting with a smaller quantum system for testing and validation before scaling up to production-ready configurations. Comprehensive training programs were developed for system administrators, researchers, and end-users, including workshops, documentation, and hands-on tutorials. The team established monitoring and maintenance protocols to ensure high system availability and implemented security measures to protect sensitive quantum computations. Regular calibration procedures were put in place to maintain quantum gate fidelities and minimize errors. The implementation also included creating a support ecosystem with dedicated quantum computing experts available to assist users with algorithm development and optimization.",
  "results_and_business_impact": "The partnership has achieved significant results in advancing European quantum computing capabilities. The integrated quantum-classical system at CSC has enabled researchers from across Europe to access quantum computing resources for various applications, including quantum chemistry simulations, optimization problems, and machine learning tasks. Early users have reported acceleration in specific computational tasks, particularly in molecular simulation and combinatorial optimization problems. The availability of the quantum system has catalyzed the formation of new research collaborations and attracted funding for quantum algorithm development. From a business perspective, the partnership has positioned all three organizations as leaders in the European quantum ecosystem. IQM has validated its quantum hardware in a production environment, strengthening its market position. Eviden has demonstrated its capability to integrate complex quantum systems, opening new business opportunities. CSC has enhanced its position as a premier European supercomputing center by offering cutting-edge quantum resources. The partnership has also contributed to workforce development, with numerous researchers and students gaining hands-on quantum computing experience. Additionally, the success has attracted interest from industrial partners seeking to explore quantum computing applications in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, finance, and logistics.",
  "future_directions": "The partnership has outlined ambitious plans for future development and expansion. Near-term goals include scaling up the quantum processor to higher qubit counts while maintaining or improving gate fidelities. The organizations plan to implement more advanced error correction schemes as the technology matures, moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. There are plans to expand the software ecosystem, including developing specialized libraries for quantum machine learning, optimization, and simulation tailored to European research and industry needs. The partnership aims to establish a quantum computing hub that serves as a center of excellence for quantum algorithm development and training. Future initiatives include creating industry-specific quantum computing solutions and establishing partnerships with European businesses to develop practical quantum applications. The organizations are also exploring the integration of other quantum computing modalities, potentially including photonic or trapped-ion systems, to provide users with access to diverse quantum computing technologies. Long-term vision includes contributing to the development of quantum internet infrastructure and distributed quantum computing capabilities.",
